Seeds of Joy
2015-05-13

seeds of joy
  fling
from tiny hands
  as you spin

tired eyes
  brighten
over soft smiles
  as you spin

hearts warm and
  connect
with warmed hearts
  as you spin

your joy, my lovelies
is the world's pleasure
your pleasure, my angels
is the world's delight
your delight, princesses
is my solace

keep dancing, my beauties
dynamos of blessing
keep dancing, cherubim
you're ushering
Heaven in
