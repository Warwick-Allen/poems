Chains of Sorrow
1997-05-19

{Verse 1}
Why so downcast, oh my soul?
Do thou knowest not
Joy is thine to hold?

{Verse 2}
Needlessly you ache
You wear the coat of despair
But it is warm, no coat is needed

{Verse 3}
Joy for you was bought
At the price of innocent blood
Shed upon a cross

{Verse 4}
Do you not know
That you deny His blood
By holding on to sorrow?

{Chorus 1}
For sorrow is the devil's tool
And melancholy Satan's friend

{Verse 5}
&ldquo;Cast away your woes
And lay them upon Me&rdquo;
My saviour says

{Verse 6}
Oh, but were it that easy
I hold my sadness tight
In a fist that I can't open

{Chorus 2}
For sorrow is my drug
And time my needle

{Bridge}
How soothing it is here
Where a slice of fantasy breaks through the reality
And reality into the fantasy

{Verse 7}
Still I am aware
That the moment is but fleeting
---A sigh among the screams

{Verse 8}
I wish the needle would be broken
But I'm not ready for that
I need a new drug

<h3>Thematic Architecture and Spiritual Dialectic</h3>
&quot;Chains of Sorrow&quot; presents a sophisticated exploration of the
  tension between Christian theology and psychological reality, structured
  as a dialogue between faith and despair. The lyrical persona engages in
  what might be termed a &quot;theodicy of the soul&quot;—questioning not
  God's justice in allowing suffering, but rather the individual's
  complicity in perpetuating their own spiritual and emotional torment.
<h3>Linguistic Register and Biblical Resonance</h3>
The opening verses employ deliberately archaic diction (&quot;Do thou
  knowest not,&quot; &quot;Joy is thine to hold&quot;) that immediately
  establishes a biblical register, evoking the Psalms' characteristic
  self-interrogation (c.f. Psalm 43).  This linguistic choice creates
  semantic distance between the speaker and their contemporary suffering,
  suggesting an attempt to frame personal anguish within established
  religious discourse. The shift from archaic to modern vernacular as the
  song progresses mirrors the movement from theological abstraction to
  psychological immediacy.
<h3>Metaphorical Structures: Clothing, Commerce, and Chemistry</h3>
The lyrical architecture relies on three primary metaphorical systems. The
  clothing metaphor (&quot;coat of despair&quot;) suggests depression as
  something worn but removable, whilst the commercial imagery
  (&quot;bought,&quot; &quot;price of innocent blood&quot;) frames salvation
  within transactional terms that ultimately prove insufficient for the
  speaker's emotional reality. Most significantly, the drug metaphor
  transforms abstract sorrow into concrete addiction, with &quot;time my
  needle&quot; representing a particularly striking image of temporal
  entrapment.
<h3>Structural Irony and Theological Paradox</h3>
The song's greatest literary achievement lies in its structural irony.
  Whilst early verses present orthodox Christian solutions to despair, the
  speaker simultaneously demonstrates their inability to accept these
  remedies.  The line &quot;Oh, but were it that easy&quot; serves as the
  poem's emotional fulcrum, acknowledging the gap between intellectual
  assent and experiential transformation. This creates a theological
  paradox: the speaker believes in grace whilst remaining unable to receive
  it.
<h3>The Bridge as Liminal Space</h3>
The bridge section functions as both formal and thematic transition,
  representing what anthropologists term &quot;liminal space&quot;—the
  threshold between states of being. The imagery of fantasy and reality
  interpenetrating suggests dissociation or escapism, yet the speaker's
  awareness that &quot;the moment is but fleeting&quot; prevents complete
  retreat from consciousness. This section demonstrates remarkable
  psychological sophistication in depicting the temporary reprieve that
  fantasy provides from overwhelming reality.
<h3>Conclusion: Addiction as Spiritual Metaphor</h3>
The final verses' equation of sorrow with addiction represents more
  than mere metaphor—it suggests that emotional patterns can exhibit the
  same compulsive, self-destructive characteristics as substance dependency.
  The closing admission &quot;I need a new drug&quot; indicates awareness
  without capacity for change, positioning the speaker in what recovery
  literature terms &quot;pre-contemplative&quot; stage. The song thus
  achieves its literary power not through resolution but through honest
  depiction of spiritual and psychological stasis.
The work's enduring resonance lies in its refusal to provide easy
  answers to complex emotional realities, instead offering what Keats termed
  &quot;negative capability&quot;—the ability to remain in uncertainty and
  doubt without irritably reaching after fact and reason.
