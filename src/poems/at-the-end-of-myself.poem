At The End of Myself
2025-06-17

{Verse 1}
I'm weary, and my all is not enough,
And the road ahead stretches long and rough.
/.ai{I'm} kneeling, empty, /.ai{nothing left to give,}
Here, /.ai{in surrender, I begin to live.}

{Chorus 1}
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
When it's no longer I, but He who lives in me,
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
/.ai{He lifts me up} and /.ai{He carries me.}

{Verse 2}
In front of me, tasks beyond my might,
/.ai{And every step,} a battle and a fight.
/.ai{I'm lost in the struggle, but} in this place,
I rest in His mercy, and in His grace.

{Chorus 2}
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
/.ai{In the breaking of my pride, His mercy reigns.}
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
/.ai{He holds me close, through every storm and pain.}

{Verse 3}
All I have to offer is tears and loss,
So I fall before the redeeming cross.
His strength is perfect when I know my weakness.
/.ai{In} knowing my emptiness, /.ai{I find His} fullness.

{Chorus 3}
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
/.ai{In the stillness of surrender,} He will /.ai{sustain.}
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
Through it all, His grace and power remain.

{Bridge}
When my race is run,
His has just begun.
When I am undone,
I rest in the Son.

{Chorus 4}
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
/.ai{In the ashes of my plans, His hope remains.}
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
So here I rest, /.ai{in the power of His name.}

{Coda}
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.

The song <em>At the End of Myself</em> is a poignant exploration of human
    frailty, spiritual surrender and divine empowerment, deeply rooted in
    Christian theology and scriptural references. Written in a confessional
    and meditative tone, the lyrics articulate a journey from exhaustion and
    inadequacy to reliance on God's strength. This analysis examines the
    song's thematic progression, its use of scriptural allusions, and the
    deliberate choice of Bible translations to convey its message.

<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
The song's central theme is the paradox of finding strength in
    weakness through surrender to God. This is introduced in Verse 1, where
    the speaker describes weariness and insufficiency ("my all is not
    enough") but discovers life through surrender.  The recurring motif
    of being "at the end of myself" in the choruses underscores a
    state of personal depletion as the prerequisite for divine intervention.
    This aligns with Christian teachings on humility and dependence on God,
    particularly echoed in 2 Corinthians 12:9, where God's grace is
    sufficient in weakness, a concept implicitly woven throughout the song.
Each verse builds on this theme by depicting increasing levels of struggle
    and surrender.  Verse 2 portrays overwhelming tasks and battles, yet finds
    solace in God's mercy and grace.  Verse 3 deepens the emotional
    intensity, with the speaker offering only "tears and loss" at
    the "redeeming cross," a clear reference to Christ's
    atonement.  The bridge shifts to an eschatological perspective,
    contrasting the speaker's finite "race" with God's
    eternal work, culminating in rest in "the Son" (a
    Christological title).  The coda, quoting Psalm 23, concludes with a
    serene affirmation of God's guidance and restoration, providing a
    resolution to the song's earlier turmoil.

<h3>Scriptural References and Translation Choices</h3>
The song is saturated with scriptural allusions, drawing from multiple
    Bible translations to enhance its lyrical and theological impact.  The
    most prominent reference is the repeated line in the choruses, "I
    can do all things through Him who gives me strength," directly
    quoting Philippians 4:13 from the New International Version (NIV).  This
    verse aligns with the song's theme of divine empowerment in human
    weakness.  The choice of the NIV rendition offers contemporary
    accessibility and rhythmic suitability for lyrical repetition.
The coda explicitly quotes Psalm 23:1--3 from the King James Version
    (KJV), evident in its archaic language: "He maketh me to lie down in
    green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my
    soul."  The KJV's poetic cadence and solemnity lend a timeless,
    almost liturgical quality to the song's conclusion, evoking a sense
    of divine comfort and finality.  This contrasts with the NIV's modern
    phrasing in the choruses, suggesting a deliberate juxtaposition of
    contemporary and traditional expressions of faith to bridge personal
    experience with historical scripture.
Other scriptural influences are less explicit but discernible.  For
    instance, Verse 3's line, "His strength is perfect when I know
    my weakness," echoes 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is
    sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."  This
    verse informs the song's nuanced articulation of weakness as a
    conduit for divine strength.  Similarly, the imagery of the
    "redeeming cross" in Verse 3 alludes to the crucifixion
    narratives (e.g., 1 Corinthians 1:18), symbolising salvation and
    surrender.  The bridge's reference to resting "in the
    Son" draws from Christological passages like John 15:4--5,
    where abiding in Christ is essential for spiritual vitality.

<h3>Structural and Poetic Devices</h3>
The song's structure reinforces its theological message.  The four
    verses and choruses progress from despair to hope, with each chorus
    slightly varying to reflect the speaker's growing trust in God.  For
    example, Chorus 1 focuses on Christ living in the speaker, while Chorus 4
    speaks of resting "in the power of His name," indicating a
    shift in thought from indwelling to worshipful reliance.  The bridge
    serves as a theological pivot, introducing Christ's eternal
    perspective, while the coda's scriptural quotation provides a
    meditative finish.
Poetically, the lyrics employ vivid imagery and contrasts.  The
    "long and rough" road (Verse 1) and "storm and
    pain" (Chorus 2) evoke life's hardships, while "green
    pastures" and "still waters" (Coda) offer divine
    respite.  The repetition of "at the end of myself" creates a
    rhythmic anchor, mirroring the cyclical nature of spiritual surrender.
    The bridge's concise parallelism ("When my race is run, /
    "His has just begun") distils the song's eschatological
    hope.

<h3>Theological and Emotional Resonance</h3>
The choice of translations---NIV for the choruses and KJV for the
    coda, with evidence of English Standard Version (ESV) influences
    elsewhere---reflects a careful curation of scriptural voices.  The
    NIV's dynamic phrasing in Philippians 4:13 appeals to modern
    listeners, grounding the song's personal narrative.  The KJV's
    Psalm 23 invokes a collective, historical faith, connecting the
    individual's journey to a broader Christian tradition.  The
    ESV's influence, with its emphasis on precision, supports the
    song's doctrinal clarity, particularly in its Pauline allusions to
    weakness and grace.  Together, these translations create a multifaceted
    scriptural foundation that resonates both emotionally and theologically.
The song's emotional power lies in its raw vulnerability.  By depicting
    a speaker who is "weary," "empty," and offering only
    "tears," it invites listeners to relate their struggles.  The
    progression from exhaustion to rest mirrors the Christian narrative of
    redemption, making the song a compelling devotional tool.  Its scriptural
    anchoring ensures theological depth, while its lyrical craftsmanship
    ensures universal relatability.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<em>At the End of Myself</em> is a lyrically and theologically
    sophisticated song that navigates the tension between human limitation and
    divine strength.  Its scriptural references, drawn from the NIV, KJV and
    ESV, are strategically employed to reinforce its message of surrender and
    empowerment.  The NIV's Philippians 4:13 drives the song's
    central affirmation, the KJV's Psalm 23 provides a timeless
    conclusion, and the ESV's influence lends doctrinal precision.
    Through its vivid imagery, poetic structure, and emotional authenticity,
    the song offers a profound reflection on faith, making it a resonant piece
    for both personal devotion and communal worship.
