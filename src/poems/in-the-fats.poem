In the Fats
1997-08-14

Who said that this would happen?
Who dictated that life would
Become as it had once been?

This is not what is written for me
In the Book
I am more
Well, I can be more
Than this

I am somebody
More than that
I am a child of God
A servant of the Almighty

He has plans for me
This I must remember
Always
