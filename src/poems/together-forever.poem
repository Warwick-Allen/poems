Together, Forever
2003-01-01

{Verse 1}
Take my heart, I'll take yours
Take my life, just as it is
Take my hand, we'll take a step
Let us walk, together, forever

{Verse 2}
Make a start, you with me
On this road, me with you
Let it be, just how it will
As we walk, together, forever

{Verse 3}
Let me lead, when I will
Let me follow, when need be
Let us stay, hand in hand
As we walk, together, forever

{Bridge}
The walk uncertain
The road unknown
But a light unto our path
Will show where we're going

{Verse 4}
On the Christ, we'll fix our gaze
To the Lord, we'll turn our hearts
Where He leads, there we'll go
As we walk, together, forever

{Verse 5}
When it ends, this walk of ours
It will have only just begun
A new road through eternity
We will walk, together, forever

# Structure and Form

The song employs a five-verse structure with a bridge, creating an
extended narrative arc that mirrors the journey it describes. The
consistent refrain &quot;As we walk, together, forever&quot; functions as
both a musical anchor and thematic touchstone, reinforcing the central
metaphor of life as a shared pilgrimage. The addition of the bridge
between verses three and four creates a crucial pivot point, introducing
uncertainty before resolving into divine guidance.

# Thematic Development

The lyrics demonstrate a sophisticated progression from the purely
personal to the transcendent. The opening verses establish a covenant
between two individuals through imperative language (&quot;Take my
heart,&quot; &quot;Make a start&quot;), evolving into reciprocal
partnership (&quot;Let me lead,&quot; &quot;Let me follow&quot;). This
human-centred foundation then expands to encompass divine relationship in
verse four, where &quot;the Christ&quot; becomes the focal point of their
shared journey.

The bridge serves as a theological and literary hinge, acknowledging the
fundamental uncertainty of human experience (&quot;The walk uncertain /
The road unknown&quot;) whilst affirming providential guidance. This
tension between doubt and faith reflects a mature spirituality that
acknowledges life's ambiguities whilst maintaining trust in divine
direction.

# Metaphorical Framework

The central metaphor of walking functions on multiple levels: the literal
act of two people moving together, the metaphorical journey of a romantic
relationship, and the spiritual pilgrimage of faith. The progression from
&quot;take a step&quot; to &quot;this walk of ours&quot; to &quot;a new
road through eternity&quot; creates an expanding temporal scope that
encompasses both immediate commitment and eschatological hope.

The shift from &quot;road&quot; in the early verses to &quot;path&quot; in
the bridge, then back to &quot;road&quot; in the final verse, suggests
different qualities of the journey—roads being constructed and travelled
by many, whilst paths suggest more intimate, personal routes requiring
guidance.

# Religious and Romantic Integration

The lyrics navigate the complex intersection of romantic love and
religious devotion with remarkable sophistication. Rather than treating
these as competing loyalties, the text presents them as mutually
reinforcing. The romantic commitment gains depth and permanence through
its grounding in shared faith, whilst religious devotion finds expression
through committed partnership.

The capitalised &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Lord&quot; in verse four mark
a theological declaration, but one that emerges organically from the
relational foundation established earlier. This integration suggests that
human love, properly understood, points beyond itself to divine love.

# Temporal Dimensions

The song's treatment of time moves from present commitment through
future uncertainty to eternal perspective. The final verse's
paradox—&quot;When it ends, this walk of ours / It will have only just
begun&quot;—employs eschatological imagery that transforms temporal
limitation into infinite possibility. The phrase &quot;through
eternity&quot; elevates the relationship beyond mortal constraints whilst
maintaining its essential character as a shared journey.

# Language and Tone

The diction remains accessible whilst avoiding sentimentality. The
repeated use of &quot;Let&quot; constructions creates a tone of invitation
rather than demand, suggesting mutual submission rather than dominance.
The simple, direct language mirrors the straightforward commitment being
described, whilst the religious terminology in verse four maintains
reverence without lapsing into archaic formality.

# Conclusion

These lyrics succeed in creating a unified vision of romantic and
spiritual commitment that avoids the pitfalls of either secular
romanticism or disembodied spirituality. The walking metaphor provides
coherence whilst allowing for growth and development. The result is a text
that functions effectively as both popular song and contemporary hymn,
speaking to couples seeking to ground their relationship in shared faith
whilst remaining accessible to broader audiences.
