[Intro]
Praise the Lord!

[Verse 1]
Praise, O servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!

[Verse 2]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
from this time forth and for evermore!

[Verse 3]
From the rising of the sun to its setting,
the name of the Lord is to be praised!

[Verse 4]
The Lord is high above all nations,
and his glory above the heavens!

[Verse 5]
Who is like the Lord our God,
who is seated on high,

[Verse 6]
who looks far down
on the heavens and the earth?

[Verse 7]
He raises the poor from the dust
and lifts the needy from the ash heap,

[Verse 8]
to make them sit with princes,
with the princes of his people.

[Verse 9]
He gives the barren woman a home,
making her the joyous mother of children.

[Outro]
Praise the Lord!
