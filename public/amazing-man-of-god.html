  <div class="poem-body">Lord, I want to serve You.<br />How I wish I were
    able,<br />And capable, and ready.<br />I know they say that it doesn't
    matter,<br />That You can use me anyway.<br />I guess that my feeble
    mind<br />Has trouble comprehending that fact.<br />Please, Lord,<br />Make
    me an &ldquo;amazing man of God&rdquo;.<br /></div>
