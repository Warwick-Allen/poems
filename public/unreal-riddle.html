    I see writing on the wall<br />
    I want to taste the blood<br />
    But I know it&apos;s not real<br />
    Just my mind playing cruel games<br />
    But these games themselves<br />
    Cause the blood to be real<br />
    I think, I don&apos;t know<br />
    <br />
    The blood is not there<br />
    I painted the picture myself<br />
    With words I don&apos;t understand<br />
    On a wall that doesn&apos;t exist<br />
    And blood is on the wall<br />
    I think, I don&apos;t know<br />
    <br />
    My very thoughts give the wall substance<br />
    And make the blood rich, warm, red: real<br />
    But the words are still a riddle<br />
    A riddle is a riddle<br />
    Even if formed in my own mind<br />
    Surely I can decipher it<br />
    I think, I don&apos;t know<br />
    <br />
    The wall keeps me safe<br />
    Even if the writing scares me<br />
    The wall shelters me<br />
    From the cold wind of reality<br />
    I guess I want the wall<br />
    I built it<br />
    I think, I don&apos;t know<br />
    <br />
    Maybe I didn&apos;t write the words<br />
    Or build the wall<br />
    But I must have<br />
    For the words confuse, the wall imprisons<br />
    Nobody else would harm me<br />
    Everything is imagined<br />
    I think, I think&hellip;<br />

    <h2>Analysis of <em>Unreal Riddle</em> (song arrangement)</h2>
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      &quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; presents an exploration of psychological
      confinement and the paradoxical nature of self-constructed mental prisons.
      The song operates as a metaphysical meditation on the relationship between
      perception, reality, and personal agency, employing the central metaphor
      of blood-written words upon an imaginary wall to examine themes of guilt,
      isolation, and epistemic uncertainty.
    </p>
    <h3 id="central-metaphor-and-symbolism">Central Metaphor and Symbolism</h3>
    <p>
      The dominant metaphor of the wall inscribed with blood serves multiple
      symbolic functions throughout the piece. The wall represents psychological
      barriers&mdash;both protective and imprisoning&mdash;that the speaker has
      constructed within their own mind. The blood, repeatedly emphasised as
      &quot;not real&quot; yet paradoxically present, embodies the complex
      relationship between imagined and experienced trauma. This duality
      reflects the genuine psychological impact of mental constructs, even when
      recognised as illusory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase &quot;writing on the wall&quot; invokes biblical connotations
      of divine judgment and prophecy, yet here it becomes deeply personal and
      self-authored. The speaker&#39;s identification as the &quot;guilty
      artist&quot; transforms them from passive recipient of judgment to active
      creator of their own psychological torment, raising questions about
      culpability and self-determination.
    </p>
    <h3 id="structure-and-repetition">Structure and Repetition</h3>
    <p>
      The song&#39;s structure reinforces its thematic content through cyclical
      repetition. The recurring pre-chorus &quot;I think, I don&#39;t know&quot;
      encapsulates the speaker&#39;s epistemic crisis&mdash;the fundamental
      uncertainty about their own mental processes and agency. This phrase
      becomes increasingly significant as it appears throughout, suggesting a
      mind caught between rational analysis and emotional confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repetitive nature of the chorus creates a sense of being trapped
      within a loop, mirroring the psychological imprisonment described in the
      lyrics. The escalating repetition in the outro (&quot;I think, I
      think&hellip;&quot;) suggests either mounting anxiety or the mechanical
      nature of obsessive thought patterns.
    </p>
    <h3 id="progression-of-self-understanding">
      Progression of Self-Understanding
    </h3>
    <p>
      The five verses trace a journey of gradual, though incomplete,
      self-awareness. The progression moves from initial confusion (&quot;their
      meaning I can&#39;t grasp&quot;) through growing recognition of personal
      responsibility (&quot;I built the wall, my cloister&quot;) to final
      questioning of agency (&quot;Could it really be me who&#39;s written those
      dread words?&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      This arc reflects the complex process of psychological insight, where
      understanding one&#39;s role in creating mental suffering doesn&#39;t
      necessarily lead to liberation from it. The speaker&#39;s growing
      awareness paradoxically increases their uncertainty, suggesting that
      self-knowledge can be as imprisoning as ignorance.
    </p>
    <h3 id="language-and-tone">Language and Tone</h3>
    <p>
      The vocabulary choices create a gothic, almost medieval atmosphere through
      words like &quot;cloister,&quot; &quot;confine,&quot; and
      &quot;captivity.&quot; This linguistic register elevates the speaker&#39;s
      internal struggle to the level of epic or religious drama, whilst
      simultaneously suggesting monastic isolation and penitential suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The juxtaposition of concrete imagery (&quot;blood,&quot;
      &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;words&quot;) with assertions of unreality creates
      cognitive dissonance that mirrors the speaker&#39;s psychological state.
      This tension between the tangible and intangible reflects broader
      philosophical questions about the nature of mental experience.
    </p>
    <h3 id="themes-of-agency-and-responsibility">
      Themes of Agency and Responsibility
    </h3>
    <p>
      Central to the song is the paradox of self-authored suffering. The speaker
      simultaneously claims authorship (&quot;I am the guilty artist&quot;) and
      questions their agency (&quot;Was this really my choice here?&quot;). This
      reflects the complex relationship between conscious will and psychological
      compulsion, particularly relevant to understanding depression, anxiety,
      and other mental health conditions where individuals may feel responsible
      for thoughts and feelings beyond their direct control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall&#39;s dual nature&mdash;as both &quot;safehold&quot; and
      prison&mdash;illustrates how psychological defences can become
      self-defeating. The protection from the &quot;harsh wind of reality&quot;
      comes at the cost of genuine freedom, suggesting the difficult balance
      between necessary psychological boundaries and self-imposed limitations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="philosophical-implications">Philosophical Implications</h3>
    <p>
      The song engages with fundamental questions about the nature of reality
      and mental experience. The assertion that imagined constructs can have
      real effects (&quot;My thoughts give the wall substance&quot;) touches on
      phenomenological philosophy and the reality of subjective experience. The
      speaker&#39;s situation exemplifies how mental constructs, even when
      recognised as constructs, retain their power to affect behaviour and
      emotion.
    </p>
    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      &quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; succeeds as both a psychological portrait and
      philosophical meditation. Its strength lies in its refusal to offer simple
      resolutions to complex mental states. The speaker&#39;s journey towards
      self-understanding doesn&#39;t culminate in liberation but in deeper
      recognition of their paradoxical situation. The song&#39;s power derives
      from its honest depiction of how self-awareness can coexist with continued
      psychological entrapment, making it a particularly nuanced exploration of
      mental imprisonment and the elusive nature of personal freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work ultimately suggests that understanding the mechanisms of our
      psychological prisons may be a necessary first step towards freedom, even
      if that understanding doesn&#39;t immediately provide the key to escape.
      In this way, the &quot;riddle&quot; of the title remains appropriately
      unsolved, reflecting the ongoing nature of psychological struggle and
      self-discovery.
