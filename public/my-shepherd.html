  <div class="poem-body">Often I wander<br />Often I stray<br />From the path
    You've chosen for me<br />From Your blessed way<br /><br />Often I
    declare<br />My love for You<br />Yet that same love I deny<br />In the
    things that I do<br /><br />But just when it seems I've gone that little too
    far<br />When my will differs from that of Your own<br />When Your love
    isn't my guiding star<br />When I try to go it alone<br /><br />You reach
    out Your hand<br />You draw me near<br />You wrap Your arms around
    me<br />In a hug so dear<br /><br />And I know Your love<br />A love so
    true<br />And I wonder why I do<br />Those things that don't please
    You<br /><br />Then You set me back down on my way<br />The path that You'd
    have me journey<br />And gently squeeze my hand to say<br />&ldquo;Child,
    all the way&mdash;it's you and Me.&rdquo;<br /></div>
