<span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
Oh Lord, You laid the earth in motion,<br />
Spoke the stars to light the sky.<br />
The wind sings endless admiration,<br />
And the mountains testify.<br />
I walked in dust, my heart was broken,<br />
Lost my all beneath Your gaze,<br />
Yet still Your voice, it softly spoken,<br />
Guided me through the shadowed days.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Great are You, God, in the storm and the flame,<br />
Goodness flows from Your unequaled name.<br />
I lift my eyes from the tear-stained sod,<br />
And sing of the greatness of my God.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
You let the tempest tear my shelter,<br />
Stripped my hands of fleeting gold,<br />
But in the silence, I felt Your splendor,<br />
A wealth that cannot be stole&apos;.<br />
Your knowledge boundless, wisdom greater,<br />
Beyond what mortal minds can know.<br />
In every trial, I stand and wonder,<br />
At the mercy You still show.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Great are You, God, in the storm and the flame,<br />
Goodness flows from Your unequaled name.<br />
I lift my eyes from the tear-stained sod,<br />
And sing of the greatness of my God.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Bridge]</span><br />
Who am I to question Your purpose?<br />
I'm dust beneath Your boundless flame,<br />
You hold the dawn, the dusk, the cosmos,<br />
And call me gently by my name.<br />
From ashes, Lord, You lift my soul,<br />
Your love remains, it makes me whole.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Great are You, God, in the storm and the flame,<br />
Goodness flows from Your unequaled name.<br />
I lift my eyes from the tear-stained sod,<br />
And sing of the greatness of my God.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Outro]</span><br />
So here I stand, though scarred and humbled,<br />
Before Your throne, my spirit free,<br />
The world may shake, the proud may stumble,<br />
But Your grace is all I see.<br />
Oh Lord of all, of dust and glory,<br />
Forever Yours, my song will be.<br />
