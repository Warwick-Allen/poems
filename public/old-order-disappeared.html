    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Order Disappeared&rdquo; is a compelling piece that navigates
      the tension between observed suffering and transcendent hope, ultimately
      resolving in explicitly Christian eschatological vision.

      Structure and Voice as Ministerial Act
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poem employs a distinctive dual perspective that takes on particular
      significance when read as supportive address. The opening stanzas
      establish an unnamed &ldquo;they&rdquo; as a threatening collective force,
      described through visceral imagery of violence: &ldquo;bite and tear /
      flesh and skin.&rdquo; This creates an almost predatory atmosphere
      reminiscent of Psalm 22&#39;s imagery of enemies as &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; but functions here not merely as poetic device but as
      validation of the addressee&#39;s experience of affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      What proves particularly poignant is the speaker&#39;s initial positioning
      as detached observer&mdash;&ldquo;I float on by / observing /
      immune&rdquo;&mdash;followed by the vulnerable question &ldquo;how?&rdquo;
      This confession of bewilderment transforms what might appear as callous
      detachment into honest acknowledgement of the mystery of differential
      suffering. The repetition of &ldquo;how?&rdquo; later in the poem creates
      a structural echo that binds together questions of both immunity and
      sustenance, suggesting the speaker&#39;s movement from puzzled observer to
      committed supporter.

      Biblical Intertextuality as Consolatory Resource
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poem&#39;s most explicit biblical resonance appears in the penultimate
      stanza, which draws directly from Revelation 21:4: &ldquo;every tear
      He&#39;ll wipe / pain will be no more / the old order disappeared.&rdquo;
      Read as supportive address, this passage functions not as abstract
      theological statement but as concrete promise offered to one presently
      afflicted. The poet transforms the biblical text&#39;s word order
      (&ldquo;God will wipe away every tear&rdquo;) through inversion and
      contraction (&ldquo;every tear He'll wipe&rdquo;), creating immediacy
      within prophetic vision that serves pastoral rather than merely literary
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing reference to Philippians 4:13&mdash;&ldquo;you can do / all
      things through / Him who gives / you strength&rdquo;&mdash;takes on the
      character of gentle exhortation rather than triumphalist declaration, its
      enjambment softening what might otherwise read as aggressive certainty
      into tender encouragement.

      Theological Implications as Pastoral Theology
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poem&#39;s theological sophistication lies in its refusal to minimise
      suffering whilst maintaining Christian hope. The speaker doesn&#39;t deny
      the reality of the loved one&#39;s affliction&mdash;the &ldquo;they&rdquo;
      who &ldquo;swamp,&rdquo; &ldquo;strangle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;drag
      down&rdquo;&mdash;but rather positions transcendence as both mystery
      (&ldquo;how?&rdquo;) and available resource (&ldquo;in His / love&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates what one might term a &ldquo;theology of
      accompaniment&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker moves from bewildered observation
      to committed support, reminiscent of the incarnational movement whereby
      divine love enters human suffering without removing its reality but
      transforming its meaning.
    </p>

      Literary Technique as Pastoral Method
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poem&#39;s strength as consolatory literature lies in its restraint.
      The short lines and simple diction avoid the pitfalls of religious
      consolation that can become platitudinous or dismissive of genuine pain.
      The repetition of &ldquo;how?&rdquo; functions as shared wonder rather
      than demanded explanation&mdash;a sophisticated pastoral positioning that
      acknowledges mystery without claiming false understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progression from second person (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) to first person
      (&ldquo;I&rdquo;) to divine third person (&ldquo;He&rdquo;) creates a
      movement from acknowledged suffering through human solidarity to divine
      resource, mapping the pastoral journey from empathy to hope.

      Critical Assessment as Devotional Literature
    </h3>
    <p>
      Whilst the poem successfully integrates biblical promise with present
      suffering, one might question whether the resolution addresses the full
      complexity of sustained affliction. However, read as occasional verse
      written for pastoral purposes, such concerns may miss the point. The
      &ldquo;old order disappeared&rdquo; functions not as theological argument
      but as vision offered to one who needs hope more than explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work succeeds in creating what one could call &ldquo;pastoral
      modernism&rdquo;&mdash;maintaining contemporary poetic sensibilities
      whilst drawing upon traditional consolatory resources, achieving that
      delicate balance between honesty about suffering and confidence in divine
      care that marks effective spiritual counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, &ldquo;Old Order Disappeared&rdquo; demonstrates how
      biblical vision can serve contemporary pastoral care through verse,
      offering not theological resolution but companionship in suffering and
      gentle direction towards transcendent hope. As occasional poetry written
      in love, it succeeds in its primary purpose: to offer comfort whilst
      acknowledging the genuine mystery of differential suffering.
