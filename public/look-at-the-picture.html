whom do you see<br />
is it you<br />
is it me<br />
a slice of<br />
&nbsp; humanity<br />
<br />
look at the picture<br />
whom do you see<br />
is it you<br />
is it He<br />
a slice of<br />
&nbsp; divinity<br />
<br />
odd is the picture<br />
laid out here now<br />
it is mixed<br />
far too mixed<br />
not as it<br />
&nbsp; it should be<br />
<br />
that day of despair<br />
we wanted to see<br />
truth was lost<br />
truth was won<br />
won back at<br />
&nbsp; Calvery<br />
<br />
look at the picture<br />
sprinkled with Blood<br />
it was you<br />
now it&apos;s He<br />
Dad sees His<br />
&nbsp; purity<br />
<br />
beautiful&apos;s the picture<br />
our Dad does see<br />
sin is hid<br />
taken away<br />
it is rid<br />
&nbsp; eternally<br />
<br />
beautiful&apos;s the picture<br />
we strain to see<br />
is it true<br />
could it be<br />
us restored<br />
&nbsp; completely<br />
