    Merely given me a life worth living,<br />
    Shown me love to which none can compare,<br />
    A hope of a future, amazing and exciting.<br />
    You've given me this, for free.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Chorus 1]</span><br/>Should I be grateful?<br />
    Should I show it?<br />
    Should I fervently praise You,<br />
    And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth?<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br/>After all, You only sent Your Son<br />
    To die in sheer agony,<br />
    To be cut off from Your love,<br />
    To be crushed by the weight of my sin,<br />
    So that I might know You, and live.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Chorus 2]</span><br/>You'd think I'd be grateful.<br />
    You'd think I'd want to show it.<br />
    You'd think I'd fervently praise You,<br />
    And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br/>What act of gratitude would be worthy<br />
    To give thanks for what You have done?<br />
    Nothing, really, but I could make a start,<br />
    Such as giving You all that I have and all that I am,<br />
    And living Your will in all that I do.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Chorus 3]</span><br/>Father, I am grateful,<br />
    And I want to show it.<br />
    I shall fervently praise You,<br />
    And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Verse 4]</span><br/>If giving You my life and living Your will<br />
    Were the least that I could do,<br />
    You'd think that I'd manage that.<br />
    But no, I fail, I let You down.<br />
    Sometimes I think I'm more of a hindrance than a help to Your kingdom.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Chorus 4]</span><br/>Lord, I am grateful;<br />
    Help me to show it.<br />
    Teach me to fervently praise You,<br />
    And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />
<br/><span class="song-segment">[Verse 5]</span><br/>Thank You, Father, for Your grace,<br />
    And for Your infinitely patient love.<br />
    Thank You that whenever I fall,<br />
    You catch me and comfort me with Your tender presence,<br />
    And You're always ready to forgive.
