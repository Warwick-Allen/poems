    O rejoice, all you peoples of the Earth!<br />
    Rejoice, for the Lord is with us,<br />
    And God is among us,<br />
    And Immanuel is His name.<br />
    <br />
    For unto us He was given,<br />
    And for our sake He was slain;<br />
    That God&apos;s love shan't be hidden,<br />
    He suffered our pain.<br />
    <br />
    But our Lord, He is risen;<br />
    His glory we shall proclaim.<br />
    <br />
    O rejoice, all you peoples of the Earth!<br />
    Rejoice, for the Lord is with us,<br />
    And God is among us,<br />
    And Jesus is His name.<br />

    O rejoice, all you peoples of the Earth!<br />
    Rejoice, for the Lord is with us,<br />
    And God is among us,<br />
    And Immanuel is His name.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
    For unto us He was given,<br />

    That God&apos;s love shan't be hidden,<br />

    <span class="song-segment">[Chorus 2]</span><br />
    O rejoice, all you peoples of the Earth!<br />
    Rejoice, for the Lord is with us,<br />
    And God is among us,<br />
    And Immanuel is His name.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
    Equal with God, was His due<br />
    But He came down, became man<br />
    His rights He chose to eschew<br />
    Obediently bore our shame<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Pre-Chorus]</span><br />
    But our Lord, He is risen,<br />
    And the Name He is given,<br />
    It's above every name.<br />
    His glory we shall proclaim!<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Chorus 3]</span><br />
    O rejoice, all you peoples of the Earth!<br />
    Rejoice, for the Lord is with us,<br />
    And God is among us,<br />
    And Jesus is His name.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Outro]</span><br />
    Jesus is His name.<br />
