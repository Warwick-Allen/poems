    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
    I breathe Your Breath in the quiet,<br />
    knowing my prayer is heard.<br />
    I eat the bread, the good diet,<br />
    of Your daily, guiding Word.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
    We receive them in<br />
    the ordinary,<br />
    Your daily mercy<br />
    and Your endless grace.<br />
    The beautiful gifts,<br />
    the blessed routines,<br />
    &ldquo;ordinary means&rdquo;:<br />
    there we find Your grace.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
    As cool waters over me flowed,<br />
    life-giving grace made me new.<br />
    Your body, Your blood, gifts bestowed,<br />
    draws us, Your bride, in to You.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br />
    Together with the saints I come, <br />
    share prayer, sweet fellowship.<br />
    Your grace knits Your body as one;<br />
    in unity, we worship.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
    We receive them in<br />
    the ordinary,<br />
    Your daily mercy<br />
    and Your endless grace.<br />
    The beautiful gifts,<br />
    the blessed routines,<br />
    &ldquo;ordinary means&rdquo;:<br />
    there we find Your grace.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 4]</span><br />
    As I gladly serve Your Body<br />
    with my modest offering,<br />
    Your grace is pouring into me,<br />
    and it&apos;s I who&apos;s receiving.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Verse 5]</span><br />
    Through Your faithful teachers, preachers,<br />
    countless graces I&apos;m given.<br />
    Understanding of Your scriptures,<br />
    make You more deeply known.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Bridge]</span><br />
    And we do, we eagerly pursue <br />
    the extraordinary.<br />
    But we&apos;re happy to glory<br />
    in the ordinary.<br />
    That&apos;s where we find You.<br />
    <br />
    <span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
    We receive them in<br />
    the ordinary,<br />
    Your daily mercy<br />
    and Your endless grace.<br />
    The beautiful gifts,<br />
    the blessed routines,<br />
    &ldquo;ordinary means&rdquo;:<br />
    there we see Your face.<br />
