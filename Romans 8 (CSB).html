    <h1>
      <span id="title">Romans 8 (CSB)</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">1</span>
      Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus <span class="added-text">(there is no condemnation)</span>,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">2</span>
      because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death <span class="added-text">(we are free)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">3</span>
      For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">4</span>
      in order that the law&apos;s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">5</span>
      For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">6</span>
      Now the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace <span class="added-text">(the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">7</span>
      The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God&apos;s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">8</span>
      Those who are in the flesh cannot please God <span class="added-text">(they cannot please God)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">9</span>
      You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">10</span>
      Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness <span class="added-text">(he gives us life)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">11</span>
      And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">12</span>
      So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">13</span>
      because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">14</span>
      For all those led by God&apos;s Spirit are God&apos;s sons <span class="added-text">(we are his sons)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">15</span>
      For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">16</span>
      The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God&apos;s children <span class="added-text">(we are his children)</span>,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">17</span>
      and if children, also heirs &mdash; heirs of God and coheirs with Christ &mdash; if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">18</span>
      For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">19</span>
      For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God&apos;s sons to be revealed <span class="added-text">(creation is waiting)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">20</span>
      For the creation was subjected to futility &mdash; not willingly, but because of him who subjected it &mdash; in the hope
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">21</span>
      that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God&apos;s children.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">22</span>
      For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labour pains until now <span class="added-text">(creation is groaning)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">23</span>
      Not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits &mdash; we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">24</span>
      Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? <span class="added-text">(Why hope for what you see?)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">25</span>
      Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience <span class="added-text">(we wait with patience)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">26</span>
      In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">27</span>
      And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">28</span>
      We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose <span class="added-text">(we are called)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">29</span>
      For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">30</span>
      And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">31</span>
      What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? <span class="added-text">(Who can stand against?)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">32</span>
      He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything? <span class="added-text">(He didn't spare his son!)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">33</span>
      Who can bring an accusation against God&apos;s elect? God is the one who justifies <span class="added-text">(God is the justifier)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">34</span>
      Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">35</span>
      Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">36</span>
      As it is written:

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Because of you

       &nbsp;&nbsp; we are being put to death all day long;

       &nbsp;&nbsp; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">37</span>
      No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  <span class="added-text">(We're more than conquerors.)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">38</span>
      For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="verse-number">39</span>
      nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
