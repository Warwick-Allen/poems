<div class="poem-body">
I have a word<br />
I have two<br />
I have a thought<br />
A thought of you<br />
<br />
My thought is pleasant<br />
My thought is fond<br />
My thought is glad<br />
Of our bond<br />
<br />
A thought&apos;s a breath<br />
A fleeting dew<br />
A recurring breath<br />
My thought of you<br />
<br />
A thought preserved<br />
A thought to hold<br />
A thought of you<br />
I give you now<br />
<br />
A small token<br />
A word from me<br />
A preservation<br />
Offered humbly<br />
