<div class="poem-body">
they're all around<br />
swamping you<br />
strangling you<br />
dragging you down<br />
<br />
they bite and tear<br />
flesh and skin<br />
leaving you thin<br />
tempting your fear<br />
<br />
but I float on by<br />
observing<br />
immune<br />
how?<br />
<br />
they will take you<br />
if you allow<br />
you don't cower<br />
they will lose<br />
<br />
and you fight<br />
and won't succumb<br />
you will overcome<br />
there'll be light<br />
<br />
and here I am<br />
supporting<br />
somehow<br />
how?<br />
<br />
every tear He'll wipe<br />
pain will be no more<br />
the old order disappeared<br />
we'll live in His light<br />
<br />
you can do<br />
all things through<br />
Him who gives<br />
you strength<br />
<br />
and there He is<br />
sustaining<br />
in His<br />
love<br />
