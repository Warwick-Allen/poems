<div class="poem-body">
A sack full of kittens<br />
My words<br />
Rescued<br />
Come tumbling out<br />
Falling over each other<br />
Tripping on themselves<br />
Emancipated<br />
Weak<br />
Uncoordinated<br />
My words<br />
Feed them the milk that they need<br />
Not that they deserve<br />
Feed them with meat<br />
To make them grow<br />
My words<br />
The Lion&apos;s roar<br />
Will be heard<br />
