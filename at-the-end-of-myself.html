<span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
I&apos;m weary, and my all is not enough,<br />
And the road ahead stretches long and rough.<br />
I&apos;m kneeling, empty, nothing left to give,<br />
Here, in surrender, I begin to live.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 1]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
When it&apos;s no longer I, but He who lives in me,<br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
He lifts me up and He carries me.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
In front of me, tasks beyond my might, <br />
And every step, a battle and a fight.<br />
I&apos;m lost in the struggle, but in this place,<br />
I rest in His mercy, and in His grace.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 2]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
In the breaking of my pride, His mercy reigns.<br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
He holds me close, through every storm and pain.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br />
All I have to offer is tears and loss,<br />
So I fall before the redeeming cross.<br />
His strength is perfect when I know my weakness.<br />
In knowing my emptiness, I find His fullness.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 3]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
In the stillness of surrender, He will sustain.<br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
Through it all, His grace and power remain.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Bridge]</span><br />
When my race is run,<br />
His has just begun.<br />
When I am undone,<br />
I rest in the Son.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 4]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
In the ashes of my plans, His hope remains.<br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
So here I rest, in the power of His name.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Outro]</span><br />
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<br />
He leadeth me beside the still waters.<br />
He restoreth my soul:<br />
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness<br />
for his name&apos;s sake.<br />
