<span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
From every nation, tribe, and tongue,<br />
A multitude in white has come,<br />
Before the throne, their voices ring,<br />
To God and Lamb, their praise they bring.<br />
Sealed by grace, the chosen stand,<br />
Marked by heaven&apos;s holy hand,<br />
Through tribulation&apos;s darkened tide,<br />
They rise to glory at His side.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Glory to our God on high,<br />
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,<br />
And to the Lamb who once was slain,<br />
Forevermore we sing His name!<br />
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,<br />
Blessing and power where glory dwells,<br />
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,<br />
Unto our God, Yeshua<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span> <br />
The angels bow, the elders fall,<br />
A mighty chorus fills the hall,<br />
The One who sits upon the throne,<br />
Has called His own to their home.<br />
No hunger now, no thirst to bear,<br />
Their God will dry their every tear,<br />
By living springs of joy they stand,<br />
In the majesty of the Lamb. <br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Glory to our God on high,<br />
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,<br />
And to the Lamb who once was slain,<br />
Forevermore we sing His name!<br />
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,<br />
Blessing and power where glory dwells,<br />
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,<br />
Unto our God, Yeshua<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br />
Twelve times twelve, the thousands called,<br />
A righteous host with Him will rule,<br />
Clothed in robes of purest light,<br />
Washed in blood, made clean and bright.<br />
Day and night, their song ascends,<br />
A praise that never, never ends,<br />
For He who created with His breath,<br />
Has conquered sin and vanquished death.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Glory to our God on high,<br />
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,<br />
And to the Lamb who once was slain,<br />
Forevermore we sing His name!<br />
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,<br />
Blessing and power where glory dwells,<br />
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,<br />
Unto our God, Yeshua<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 4]</span> <br />
The bright Morning Star is coming,<br />
His just reward, He is bringing.<br />
Blessed are those who&apos;ve washed their robe,<br />
Through the city gate they may go,<br />
And they have been given the right<br />
To eat fruit of the tree of life.<br />
And the Spirit and bride invite<br />
To drink of the water of life.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus]</span><br />
Glory to our God on high,<br />
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,<br />
And to the Lamb who once was slain,<br />
Forevermore we sing His name!<br />
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,<br />
Blessing and power where glory dwells,<br />
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,<br />
Unto our God, Yeshua<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Outro]</span><br />
Forevermore, the throne we see,<br />
The Lamb, our Shepherd, sets us free,<br />
With every voice, we join in praise,<br />
Glory and honour to the Endless of Days!<br />
