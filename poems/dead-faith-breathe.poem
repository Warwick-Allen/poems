Dead Faith, Breathe
2017-06-07

You've no qualm
Recite your psalm
On the corner
Don't ignore her
She's hurting
You look

Words cavernous
Now disastrous
She will hear
You don't care
She's hurting
You ask

Pontificate
Form of hate
You say grace
See her face
She's hurting
You know

<em>&hellip; breathe &hellip;</em>

Words substantial
Being filled
In the doing
Lives combining
She's waiting
For you
