segments:
- lines: |
    I take my soul for a stroll
    Along the crumbling edge
    Cliff face, to face
    Imagined and the real

- lines: |
    I see my world dissolve
    In an unread history book
    My space, marked place
    Recorded but never told

- lines: |
    I watch and sigh as they divide
    My soul and body cannot decide
    Can't agree who'll they'll have
    Me be, so they fight
