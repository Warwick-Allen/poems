    - lines: |
        I take my soul for a stroll
        Along the crumbling edge
        Cliff face, to face
        Imagined and the real

    - lines: |
        I see my world dissolve
        In an unread history book
        My space, marked place
        Recorded but never told

    - lines: |
        I watch and sigh as they divide
        My soul and body cannot decide
        Can't agree who'll they'll have
        Me be, so they fight
