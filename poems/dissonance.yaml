  I take my soul for a stroll<br />
  Along the crumbling edge<br />
  Cliff face, to face<br />
  Imagined and the real<br />
  <br />
  I see my world dissolve<br />
  In an unread history book<br />
  My space, marked place<br />
  Recorded but never told<br />
  <br />
  I watch and sigh as they divide<br />
  My soul and body cannot decide<br />
  Can't agree who'll they'll have<br />
  Me be, so they fight<br />
