      never thought I could
      never thought I would
      'o no no no n' no no no
      it's not what you said
      just some old bones
      rattling in my head

      so I journey
      never through the heart
      can't you see
      that is where
      the trouble starts

  - lines: |
      got out of control
      got to take a hold
      'o so so so s' so so so
      just ashes and dust
      trying on my own<br />t
      hought that I must

  - lines: |
      so I wander
      never through the heart
      stop and ponder
      that is where
      the trouble starts

  - lines: |
      got to reach you
      got to run from you
      got to reach you
      tearing me in two

      simplicity's virtue
      such I teach you
      'ou you you you y' you you you
      it's all I got
      but it's a lot

  - lines: |
      so I travel (got to reach you)
      never through the heart (got to run from you)
      can't you tell
      that is where
      the trouble starts (tearing me in two)
