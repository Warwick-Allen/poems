  never thought I could
  never thought I would
  &apos;o no no no n&apos; no no no
  it&apos;s not what you said
  just some old bones
  rattling in my head

  so I journey
  never through the heart
  can&apos;t you see
  that is where
  the trouble starts

  got out of control
  got to take a hold
  &apos;o so so so s&apos; so so so
  just ashes and dust
  trying on my own<br />t
  hought that I must

  so I wander
  never through the heart
  stop and ponder
  that is where
  the trouble starts

  got to reach you
  got to run from you
  got to reach you
  tearing me in two

  simplicity&apos;s virtue
  such I teach you
  &apos;ou you you you y&apos; you you you
  it&apos;s all I got
  but it&apos;s a lot

  so I travel (got to reach you)
  never through the heart (got to run from you)
  can&apos;t you tell
  that is where
  the trouble starts (tearing me in two)
