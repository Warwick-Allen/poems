      Ah, the downfall of the romantic:
      When fanciful dreaming strays far from reality
      And returns with empty promises&mdash;
      Gains that are really losses.

      O, but what a refreshing tonic,
      To fly on the wings of fantasy,
      From time to time,
      Uplifting for soul and mind.

  - lines: |
      But remember it&#39;s also good,
      Or so I&#39;ve found,
      To keep at least one foot
      On the ground.
