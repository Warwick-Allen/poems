  Ah, the downfall of the romantic:<br />
      When fanciful dreaming strays far from reality<br />
      And returns with empty promises&mdash;<br />
      Gains that are really losses.<br />
      <br />
      O, but what a refreshing tonic,<br />
      To fly on the wings of fantasy,<br />
      From time to time,<br />
      Uplifting for soul and mind.<br />
      <br />
      But remember it&#39;s also good,<br />
      Or so I&#39;ve found,<br />
      To keep at least one foot<br />
      On the ground.<br />
