          Ah, the downfall of the romantic:
          When fanciful dreaming strays far from reality
          And returns with empty promises---
          Gains that are really losses.
      - lines: |
          O, but what a refreshing tonic,
          To fly on the wings of fantasy,
          From time to time,
          Uplifting for soul and mind.
      - lines: |
          But remember it's also good,
          Or so I've found,
          To keep at least one foot
          On the ground.
