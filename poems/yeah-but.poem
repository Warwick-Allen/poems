Yeah But
2015-05-14

On behalf of the voiceless:

please

On behalf of the heartless:

yeah, but
&nbsp; we provide quality
&nbsp; not quantity
yeah, but
&nbsp; all of these
&nbsp; just too many
yeah, but
&nbsp; 750 already
&nbsp; our good deed
yeah, but
&nbsp; mouths to feed
&nbsp; we have plenty
yeah, but
&nbsp; we are tiny
&nbsp; can't you see

anyway (this is plain to see)
there's no way (that we can help)
because (this is plain to see)
we have lost
our way
