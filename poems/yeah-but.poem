Yeah But
2015-05-14

On behalf of the voiceless:

please

On behalf of the heartless:

yeah, but
  we provide quality
  not quantity
yeah, but
  all of these
  just too many
yeah, but
  750 already
  our good deed
yeah, but
  mouths to feed
  we have plenty
yeah, but
  we are tiny
  can't you see

anyway (this is plain to see)
there's no way (that we can help)
because (this is plain to see)
we have lost
our way
