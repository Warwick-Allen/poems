Old Order Disappeared
2025-03-12

they're all around
swamping you
strangling you
dragging you down

they bite and tear
flesh and skin
leaving you thin
tempting your fear

but I float on by
observing
immune
how?

they will take you
if you allow
you don't cower
they will lose

and you fight
and won't succumb
you will overcome
there'll be light

and here I am
supporting
somehow
how?

every tear He'll wipe
pain will be no more
the old order disappeared
we'll live in His light

you can do
all things through
Him who gives
you strength

and there He is
sustaining
in His
love

"Old Order Disappeared" is a compelling piece that navigates
  the tension between observed suffering and transcendent hope, ultimately
  resolving in explicitly Christian eschatological vision.
<h3>Structure and Voice as Ministerial Act</h3>
The poem employs a distinctive dual perspective that takes on particular
  significance when read as supportive address. The opening stanzas
  establish an unnamed "they" as a threatening collective force,
  described through visceral imagery of violence: "bite and tear /
  flesh and skin." This creates an almost predatory atmosphere
  reminiscent of Psalm 22's imagery of enemies as "dogs" and
  "lions," but functions here not merely as poetic device but as
  validation of the addressee's experience of affliction.
What proves particularly poignant is the speaker's initial positioning
  as detached observer---"I float on by / observing /
  immune"---followed by the vulnerable question "how?"
  This confession of bewilderment transforms what might appear as callous
  detachment into honest acknowledgement of the mystery of differential
  suffering. The repetition of "how?" later in the poem creates
  a structural echo that binds together questions of both immunity and
  sustenance, suggesting the speaker's movement from puzzled observer to
  committed supporter.
<h3>Biblical Intertextuality as Consolatory Resource</h3>
The poem's most explicit biblical resonance appears in the penultimate
  stanza, which draws directly from Revelation 21:4: "every tear
  He'll wipe / pain will be no more / the old order disappeared."
  Read as supportive address, this passage functions not as abstract
  theological statement but as concrete promise offered to one presently
  afflicted. The poet transforms the biblical text's word order
  ("God will wipe away every tear") through inversion and
  contraction ("every tear He'll wipe"), creating immediacy
  within prophetic vision that serves pastoral rather than merely literary
  purposes.
The closing reference to Philippians 4:13---"you can do / all
  things through / Him who gives / you strength"---takes on the
  character of gentle exhortation rather than triumphalist declaration, its
  enjambment softening what might otherwise read as aggressive certainty
  into tender encouragement.
<h3>Theological Implications as Pastoral Theology</h3>
The poem's theological sophistication lies in its refusal to minimise
  suffering whilst maintaining Christian hope. The speaker doesn't deny
  the reality of the loved one's affliction---the "they"
  who "swamp," "strangle," and "drag
  down"---but rather positions transcendence as both mystery
  ("how?") and available resource ("in His / love").
This creates what one might term a "theology of
  accompaniment"---the speaker moves from bewildered observation
  to committed support, reminiscent of the incarnational movement whereby
  divine love enters human suffering without removing its reality but
  transforming its meaning.
<h3>Literary Technique as Pastoral Method</h3>
The poem's strength as consolatory literature lies in its restraint.
  The short lines and simple diction avoid the pitfalls of religious
  consolation that can become platitudinous or dismissive of genuine pain.
  The repetition of "how?" functions as shared wonder rather
  than demanded explanation---a sophisticated pastoral positioning that
  acknowledges mystery without claiming false understanding.
The progression from second person ("you") to first person
  ("I") to divine third person ("He") creates a
  movement from acknowledged suffering through human solidarity to divine
  resource, mapping the pastoral journey from empathy to hope.
<h3>Critical Assessment as Devotional Literature</h3>
Whilst the poem successfully integrates biblical promise with present
  suffering, one might question whether the resolution addresses the full
  complexity of sustained affliction. However, read as occasional verse
  written for pastoral purposes, such concerns may miss the point. The
  "old order disappeared" functions not as theological argument
  but as vision offered to one who needs hope more than explanation.
The work succeeds in creating what one could call "pastoral
  modernism"---maintaining contemporary poetic sensibilities
  whilst drawing upon traditional consolatory resources, achieving that
  delicate balance between honesty about suffering and confidence in divine
  care that marks effective spiritual counsel.
In conclusion, "Old Order Disappeared" demonstrates how
  biblical vision can serve contemporary pastoral care through verse,
  offering not theological resolution but companionship in suffering and
  gentle direction towards transcendent hope. As occasional poetry written
  in love, it succeeds in its primary purpose: to offer comfort whilst
  acknowledging the genuine mystery of differential suffering.
