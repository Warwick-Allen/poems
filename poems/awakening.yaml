  The dormant anger in my soul<br />
  A sleeping beast half aroused<br />
  Feed it now, one more time<br />
  Rusty bars soon to crumble<br />
  <br />
  Born of love<br />
  Filled with wrath<br />
  Fed on the drippings<br />
  Of a melted heart<br />
  <br />
  Awakening now<br />
  It&apos;s awakening now<br />
  <br />
  Oh my Sister!<br />
  My Sister,<br />
  I hear<br />
  My Brother!<br />
  My dear Brother,<br />
  I hear your cry<br />
  <br />
  Its bellow shatters<br />
  The frail cage<br />
  It is free<br />
  And enraged<br />
  <br />
  Injustice, you loathsome serpent<br />
  Start to quiver<br />
  Start to fear<br />
  This beast is led<br />
  By a spirit<br />
  And a Spirit<br />
  <br />
  It has no fear<br />
  It has no bounds<br />
  It will abound<br />
  &ndash; All times<br />
  &ndash; All things<br />
  &ndash; All sufficiency<br />
  The heart, the mind<br />
  The power, the providence<br />
  Of the Most High<br />
  It has<br />
  It needs<br />
  Nothing<br />
  Else<br />
  <br />
  Serpent:<br />
  Prepare<br />
  To be<br />
  Crushed<br />
