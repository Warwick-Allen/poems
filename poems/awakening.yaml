  The dormant anger in my soul
  A sleeping beast half aroused
  Feed it now, one more time
  Rusty bars soon to crumble

  Born of love
  Filled with wrath
  Fed on the drippings
  Of a melted heart

  Awakening now
  It&apos;s awakening now

  Oh my Sister!
  My Sister,
  I hear
  My Brother!
  My dear Brother,
  I hear your cry

  Its bellow shatters
  The frail cage
  It is free
  And enraged

  Injustice, you loathsome serpent
  Start to quiver
  Start to fear
  This beast is led
  By a spirit
  And a Spirit

  It has no fear
  It has no bounds
  It will abound
  &ndash; All times
  &ndash; All things
  &ndash; All sufficiency
  The heart, the mind
  The power, the providence
  Of the Most High
  It has
  It needs
  Nothing
  Else

  Serpent:
  Prepare
  To be
  Crushed
