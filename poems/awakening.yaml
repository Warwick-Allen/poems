          The dormant anger in my soul
          A sleeping beast half aroused
          Feed it now, one more time
          Rusty bars soon to crumble

      - lines: |
          Born of love
          Filled with wrath
          Fed on the drippings
          Of a melted heart

      - lines: |
          Awakening now
          It's awakening now

      - lines: |
          Oh my Sister!
          My Sister,
          I hear
          My Brother!
          My dear Brother,
          I hear your cry

      - lines: |
          Its bellow shatters
          The frail cage
          It is free
          And enraged

      - lines: |
          Injustice, you loathsome serpent
          Start to quiver
          Start to fear
          This beast is led
          By a spirit
          And a Spirit

      - lines: |
          It has no fear
          It has no bounds
          It will abound
          &ndash; All times
          &ndash; All things
          &ndash; All sufficiency
          The heart, the mind
          The power, the providence
          Of the Most High
          It has
          It needs
          Nothing
          Else

      - lines: |
          Serpent:
          Prepare
          To be
          Crushed
