A Simple Man
2002-08-03

{Verse 1}
I'm just a simple man
In the morning sun, I'll recline
With a cup of tea in hand
I think that's just fine
Yes, I'm just a simple man

{Verse 2}
I'm just a simple chap
I like food and I like wine
With good friends, I'll sit and chat
Together as we dine
Yes, I'm just a simple chap

{Verse 3}
I'm just a simple fellow
I like to be at peace all the time
To keep life relaxed and mellow
To not have much trouble on my mind
Yes, I'm just a simple fellow

{Verse 4}
I'm just a simple guy
    And if I can love my neighbour down the line
    I'll be doing well, so I'll always try
    Praying only the simple truth will leave these lips of mine
    Yes, I'm just a simple guy

{Verse 5}
I'm just a simple man
    In the quiet evening, you'll find
    Me sitting with a cup of tea in hand
    That certainly is just fine
    Yes, I'm just a simple man

# Pastoral Idealism and the Rhetoric of Contentment

"A Simple Man" presents a fascinating study in contemporary
pastoral literature, employing repetitive structural patterns to reinforce
themes of deliberate simplicity and resistance to modern complexity. The
song operates as a manifesto of contentment, structured around five verses
that follow an almost liturgical pattern of declaration, elaboration, and
affirmation.

# Structural Architecture and Repetition

The most striking literary device is the formulaic repetition that frames
each verse: the opening declaration ("I'm just a simple...")
followed by the closing affirmation ("Yes, I'm just a
simple..."). This creates a circular, almost meditative quality
reminiscent of religious refrains or folk incantations. The variation in
terminology—"man," "chap," "fellow,"
"guy"—suggests an attempt to encompass universal masculine
identity whilst maintaining colloquial authenticity.

# Pastoral Imagery and Domestic Ritual

The recurring motif of tea-drinking bookends the piece, appearing in both
the first and final verses. This creates structural symmetry whilst
establishing tea as a symbol of unhurried domesticity and Kiwi cultural
identity. The progression from "morning sun" to "quiet
evening" traces a complete diurnal cycle, suggesting the
speaker's contentment spans all hours of existence.

# Social Philosophy Through Simple Language

The fourth verse introduces the song's most complex moral sentiment:
"if I can love my neighbour down the line." This biblical echo
(referencing the commandment to love one's neighbour) elevates the
piece from mere lifestyle preference to ethical statement. The phrase
"simple truth" creates a paradox—truth itself as both
straightforward and profound.

# Anti-Materialist Aesthetic

The lyrics deliberately eschew material markers of success, instead
celebrating modest pleasures: food, wine, friendship, peace. This
positions the speaker as consciously rejecting contemporary consumer
culture in favour of what might be termed "voluntary
simplicity." The absence of technology, career ambition, or material
possessions is conspicuous and intentional.

The work ultimately functions as a gentle manifesto for mindful living,
using the pastoral tradition's celebration of simple pleasures to
critique modern complexity without explicit condemnation. Its literary
achievement lies in making philosophical contentment seem both attainable
and admirable through accessible, conversational language.
