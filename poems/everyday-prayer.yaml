          My holy Lord, my Saviour, my King
          I have within me a sincere yearning
          To every day establish my residence
          In the power of Your presence
      - lines: |
          I pray that You choose to bless me so
          A double portion of Your Spirit to bestow
          That everyday I may know You more
          Intimately than the day before
      - lines: |
          I pray that each day may begin
          With an offering of praise and exaltation
          And that each evening I will give thanks
          For Your faithful providence
      - lines: |
          Lord, make me Your instrument
          To bring comfort to those who lament
          To radiate love to those who hurt
          To extend Your kingdom on this earth
      - lines: |
          I pray I will surrender everyday
          To You, and before Your feet lay
          Anything I think, say or do
          That keeps me from coming closer to You
      - lines: |
          Every day this will be my prayer
          That through obedience, righteousness, faith and holy fear
          I will be kept under Your wonderful blessing
          And from my days all want will be missing
      - lines: |
          To daily confess every offence
          I know I need Your assistance
          I pray that no due penitence I'll fail to offer
          To You, my heart unrepentant never
      - lines: |
          I ask You, Lord, to help me ever be
          Forgiving to anyone who has done wrong to me
          And at each evening, the setting of the sun
          To be a peace with everyone
      - lines: |
          I pray for wisdom to steer clear of temptation
          And that I may overcome it through strength and firm resolution
          For discernment to recognise evil when faced with it
          I pray, and for Your Spirit to defeat it
      - lines: |
          Lord, install in me a hunger, a need
          For Your Word, living Word, to habitually read
          Upon it I shall meditate, every day, every night
          I will search deeper---it will be my light
      - lines: |
          Most of all, I thank you that everyday
          Lord Jesus, because of Your sacrifice, I may
          Come to You, and pray
          And know there's no end to everyday
