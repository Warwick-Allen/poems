  My holy Lord, my Saviour, my King
      I have within me a sincere yearning
      To every day establish my residence
      In the power of Your presence

      I pray that You choose to bless me so
      A double portion of Your Spirit to bestow
      That everyday I may know You more
      Intimately than the day before

      I pray that each day may begin
      With an offering of praise and exaltation
      And that each evening I will give thanks
      For Your faithful providence

      Lord, make me Your instrument
      To bring comfort to those who lament
      To radiate love to those who hurt
      To extend Your kingdom on this earth

      I pray I will surrender everyday
      To You, and before Your feet lay
      Anything I think, say or do
      That keeps me from coming closer to You

      Every day this will be my prayer
      That through obedience, righteousness, faith and holy fear
      I will be kept under Your wonderful blessing
      And from my days all want will be missing

      To daily confess every offence
      I know I need Your assistance
      I pray that no due penitence I&#39;ll fail to offer
      To You, my heart unrepentant never

      I ask You, Lord, to help me ever be
      Forgiving to anyone who has done wrong to me
      And at each evening, the setting of the sun
      To be a peace with everyone

      I pray for wisdom to steer clear of temptation
      And that I may overcome it through strength and firm resolution
      For discernment to recognise evil when faced with it
      I pray, and for Your Spirit to defeat it

      Lord, install in me a hunger, a need
      For Your Word, living Word, to habitually read
      Upon it I shall meditate, every day, every night
      I will search deeper&mdash;it will be my light

      Most of all, I thank you that everyday
      Lord Jesus, because of Your sacrifice, I may
      Come to You, and pray
      And know there&#39;s no end to everyday
