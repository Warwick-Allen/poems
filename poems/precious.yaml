          A lie torturous
          Sold
          By men contemptuous
          Told
          To lives precious
          Cold
          Hearts treat worthless
          Gold
          Their sole worship
          Hell
          Their course plotted
          How
          To touch minds knotted
          Tell
          Men, men corrupted
          Yell
          The truth unhindered
          Smell
          Life sweetly savoured
          Now
          Through our Saviour
          Old
          Courses Altered
          Cold
          Hearts are melted
          Evil
          Men made righteous
          All
          Souls are precious
