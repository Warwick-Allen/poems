Dissonance
2015-10-18

I take my soul for a stroll
Along the crumbling edge
Cliff face, to face
Imagined and the real

I see my world dissolve
In an unread history book
My space, marked place
Recorded but never told

I watch and sigh as they divide
My soul and body cannot decide
Can't agree who'll they'll have
Me be, so they fight
