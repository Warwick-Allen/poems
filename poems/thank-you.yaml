  When I was down
      I asked for Your hand
      You cradled me in Your arms

      When I was falling
      I asked for You to catch me
      You lifted me oh so high

      When I was in darkness
      I asked for some light
      You flooded my life with Your brilliance

      When I was lost
      I asked for directions
      You guided me by Your hand

      Now I am yours, Lord
      I was from the beginning
      At least now I know

      Never let me go, Lord
      I can&apos;t live without Your love
      The darkness scares me so
