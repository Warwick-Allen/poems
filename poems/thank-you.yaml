          When I was down
          I asked for Your hand
          You cradled me in Your arms

          When I was falling
          I asked for You to catch me
          You lifted me oh so high

          When I was in darkness
          I asked for some light
          You flooded my life with Your brilliance

          When I was lost
          I asked for directions
          You guided me by Your hand

      - lines: |
          Now I am yours, Lord
          I was from the beginning
          At least now I know

      - lines: |
          Never let me go, Lord
          I can't live without Your love
          The darkness scares me so
