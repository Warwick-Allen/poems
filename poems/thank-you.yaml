  When I was down<br />
      I asked for Your hand<br />
      You cradled me in Your arms<br />
      <br />
      When I was falling<br />
      I asked for You to catch me<br />
      You lifted me oh so high<br />
      <br />
      When I was in darkness<br />
      I asked for some light<br />
      You flooded my life with Your brilliance<br />
      <br />
      When I was lost<br />
      I asked for directions<br />
      You guided me by Your hand<br />
      <br />
      Now I am yours, Lord<br />
      I was from the beginning<br />
      At least now I know<br />
      <br />
      Never let me go, Lord<br />
      I can&apos;t live without Your love<br />
      The darkness scares me so<br />
