Hole
1996-03-14

Am I falling
Or am I jumping
I think I jumped

This hole is too big for me
I cannot see the top
I haven't yet hit the bottom

Did I jump
Or was I pushed
I think I jumped

If only I had a rope
Maybe I could climb the rope
At least I would stop going down

I'm still falling
I don't like falling
I think I jumped

Will you be my rope
You are strong
You won't break when I climb

I did jump
But I had help
Why did I jump

My Lord be my rope
So I won't fall
I can climb I won't jump

They said they wouldn't let me slip
But they pushed
I think I jumped

I will see the light
When I reach the top
Of this hole

<h3>Literary Analysis</h3>
This poem employs a powerful extended metaphor of falling into a hole to
  explore themes of agency, responsibility, and spiritual seeking. The
  structure itself mirrors the speaker's psychological state—the
  repetitive, cycling nature of the verses echoes the mental loops of
  someone trying to process a traumatic experience or difficult life
  circumstance.
The poem's most striking literary device is the refrain &quot;I think
  I jumped,&quot; which appears with slight variations throughout. This
  repetition creates a haunting uncertainty that drives the entire piece.
  The speaker's inability to definitively state whether they jumped or
  were pushed becomes the central tension, reflecting the complex nature of
  personal responsibility in situations where external pressures and
  internal choices intersect.
The poem progresses through distinct emotional stages: initial confusion
and disorientation, desperate seeking for help, spiritual turning,
betrayal and realisation, and finally hope for redemption. The imagery
shifts from secular (rope, climbing) to spiritual ("My Lord")
and back to interpersonal betrayal ("They said they wouldn't let
me slip / But they pushed"), creating a layered exploration of
different sources of support and failure.

The simple, almost childlike language belies the sophisticated
psychological portrait being painted. Short, declarative sentences mirror
the speaker's attempts to grasp onto concrete truths in a situation of
profound uncertainty.
<h3>Psychological Analysis</h3>
From a psychological perspective, this poem presents a compelling portrait
  of trauma processing and the struggle with agency versus victimhood. The
  recurring uncertainty about jumping versus being pushed suggests someone
  grappling with a situation where their own choices may have contributed to
  their harm, but external pressures or manipulation were also present.

The repetitive structure mirrors the intrusive, cycling thoughts common in
  trauma responses. The speaker's mind returns again and again to the
  central question of responsibility—a classic feature of psychological
  processing after difficult experiences, particularly those involving
  betrayal or abuse.

The progression from "Am I falling / Or am I jumping" to "I
  think I jumped" to "I did jump / But I had help" reveals
  the psychological journey from confusion to acknowledgment of complex
  causation. This reflects the therapeutic process of moving from
  black-and-white thinking to understanding the nuanced interplay between
  personal agency and external influence.

The search for a "rope"—first generally, then specifically from
  another person, then from "My Lord"—illustrates the human need
  for support systems and the progression many people make from secular to
  spiritual seeking when facing crisis. The betrayal ("They said they
  wouldn't let me slip / But they pushed") suggests a history of
  failed trust, possibly indicating relationship trauma or institutional
  betrayal.

The final movement toward hope ("I will see the light / When I reach
  the top") suggests resilience and the possibility of recovery, though
  the speaker remains "in this hole," indicating the ongoing
  nature of their struggle.

# Integrated Interpretation

Both literary and psychological readings converge on this poem's
  exploration of the complex relationship between choice and circumstance.
  The speaker appears to be processing an experience where they made
  decisions that led to harmful consequences, but within a context of
  manipulation, pressure, or betrayal by trusted others.
The poem's power lies in its refusal to provide easy answers about
  blame or responsibility. Instead, it captures the genuine confusion and
  self-examination that follows traumatic experiences, particularly those
  involving spiritual or relational betrayal. The hope that concludes the
  poem—seeing light, reaching the top—suggests not a simple resolution but a
  hard-won acceptance of the climb ahead.
This work stands as both a literary achievement in its skillful use of
  metaphor and repetition, and as a psychologically astute portrait of
  trauma, responsibility, and the search for redemption.
