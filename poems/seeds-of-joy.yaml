  seeds of joy
  &nbsp; fling
  from tiny hands
  &nbsp; as you spin

  tired eyes
  &nbsp; brighten
  over soft smiles
  &nbsp; as you spin

  hearts warm and
  &nbsp; connect
  with warmed hearts
  &nbsp; as you spin

  your joy, my lovelies
  is the world's pleasure
  your pleasure, my angels
  is the world's delight
  your delight, princesses
  is my solace

  keep dancing, my beauties
  dynamos of blessing
  keep dancing, cherubim
  you're ushering
  Heaven in
