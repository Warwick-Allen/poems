          seeds of joy
          &nbsp; fling
          from tiny hands
          &nbsp; as you spin

      - lines: |
          tired eyes
          &nbsp; brighten
          over soft smiles
          &nbsp; as you spin

      - lines: |
          hearts warm and
          &nbsp; connect
          with warmed hearts
          &nbsp; as you spin

      - lines: |
          your joy, my lovelies
          is the world's pleasure
          your pleasure, my angels
          is the world's delight
          your delight, princesses
          is my solace

      - lines: |
          keep dancing, my beauties
          dynamos of blessing
          keep dancing, cherubim
          you're ushering
          Heaven in
