  seeds of joy<br />
  &nbsp; fling<br />
  from tiny hands<br />
  &nbsp; as you spin<br />
  <br />
  tired eyes<br />
  &nbsp; brighten<br />
  over soft smiles<br />
  &nbsp; as you spin<br />
  <br />
  hearts warm and<br />
  &nbsp; connect<br />
  with warmed hearts<br />
  &nbsp; as you spin<br />
  <br />
  your joy, my lovelies<br />
  is the world's pleasure<br />
  your pleasure, my angels<br />
  is the world's delight<br />
  your delight, princesses<br />
  is my solace<br />
  <br />
  keep dancing, my beauties<br />
  dynamos of blessing<br />
  keep dancing, cherubim<br />
  you're ushering<br />
  Heaven in<br />
