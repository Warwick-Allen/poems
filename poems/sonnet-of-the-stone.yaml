          The weight of the stone, around my heart bound
          Is not enough to pull me under, but
          Just enough for the chains, my soul to cut
          And the load to keep my dreams on the ground.
          Sometimes I stand tall, my strength I have found,
          But often strength I've none, I'm in a rut,
          I long for a haven, a lonely hut
          Where, onto a page, my fears and doubts mound.

        lines: |
          From this safe place, I cry my forlorn plea
          To my Lord, I ask Him to take the stone.
          He hears, but He is teaching me to wait.
          He wants to use me, now He's moulding me,
          Yet He still lets me know I'm not alone,
          And from my shoulders He will lift the weight.
