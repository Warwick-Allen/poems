      The weight of the stone, around my heart bound<br />
          Is not enough to pull me under, but<br />
          Just enough for the chains, my soul to cut<br />
          And the load to keep my dreams on the ground.<br />
          Sometimes I stand tall, my strength I have found,<br />
          But often strength I've none, I'm in a rut,<br />
          I long for a haven, a lonely hut<br />
          Where, onto a page, my fears and doubts mound.<br />

    lines: |
      From this safe place, I cry my forlorn plea<br />
          To my Lord, I ask Him to take the stone.<br />
          He hears, but He is teaching me to wait.<br />
          He wants to use me, now He's moulding me,<br />
          Yet He still lets me know I'm not alone,<br />
          And from my shoulders He will lift the weight.
