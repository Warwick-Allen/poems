  As a planet circles its sun<br />
      To you my heart seems eternally bound<br />
      Through an irregular ellipse I run<br />
      Drifting nearer and farther, around and around<br />
      But always ending up where I began<br />
      <br />
      If only I could get enough speed<br />
      To break free of the pull<br />
      The relentless attraction, the incessant need<br />
      To escape this agonising orbit, this endless cycle<br />
      I would finally be freed<br />
      <br />
      As it is, I can discern<br />
      The light and warmth you radiate<br />
      To come closer, I desperately yearn<br />
      But I know what would be my fate<br />
      The light would vanish, but the heat would burn<br />
      <br />
      Oh, where shall I go from here<br />
      This place where wisdom and emotions clash so violently?<br />
      All I ask of you, all I dare<br />
      Is that you&#39;ll forgive my weakness graciously<br />
      And you won&#39;t take from me any of that I hold so dear<br />
