          As a planet circles its sun
          To you my heart seems eternally bound
          Through an irregular ellipse I run
          Drifting nearer and farther, around and around
          But always ending up where I began

      - lines: |
          If only I could get enough speed
          To break free of the pull
          The relentless attraction, the incessant need
          To escape this agonising orbit, this endless cycle
          I would finally be freed

      - lines: |
          As it is, I can discern
          The light and warmth you radiate
          To come closer, I desperately yearn
          But I know what would be my fate
          The light would vanish, but the heat would burn

      - lines: |
          Oh, where shall I go from here
          This place where wisdom and emotions clash so violently?
          All I ask of you, all I dare
          Is that you'll forgive my weakness graciously
          And you won't take from me any of that I hold so dear
