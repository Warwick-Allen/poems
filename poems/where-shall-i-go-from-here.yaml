  As a planet circles its sun
      To you my heart seems eternally bound
      Through an irregular ellipse I run
      Drifting nearer and farther, around and around
      But always ending up where I began

      If only I could get enough speed
      To break free of the pull
      The relentless attraction, the incessant need
      To escape this agonising orbit, this endless cycle
      I would finally be freed

      As it is, I can discern
      The light and warmth you radiate
      To come closer, I desperately yearn
      But I know what would be my fate
      The light would vanish, but the heat would burn

      Oh, where shall I go from here
      This place where wisdom and emotions clash so violently?
      All I ask of you, all I dare
      Is that you&#39;ll forgive my weakness graciously
      And you won&#39;t take from me any of that I hold so dear
