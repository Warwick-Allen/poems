Anthem of The Redeemed
2025-03-12

{Verse 1}
/.ai{From every nation, tribe, and tongue,
A multitude in white has come,
Before the throne, their voices ring,
To God and Lamb, their praise they bring.
Sealed by grace, the chosen stand,
Marked by heaven's holy hand,
Through tribulation's darkened tide,
They rise to glory at His side.}

{Chorus}
Glory /.ai{to our God on high,
To Him who reigns} over earth and /.ai{sky},
/.ai{And to the Lamb who once was slain,
Forevermore we sing His name!
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,
Blessing and power where glory dwells,}
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,
Unto our God, Yeshua

{Verse 2}
/.ai{The angels bow, the elders fall,
A mighty chorus fills the hall,
The One who sits upon the throne,
Has called His own to} their home.
/.ai{No hunger now, no thirst to bear,}
Their God /.ai{will} dry their every tear,
/.ai{By living springs of joy they stand,}
In the majesty of the Lamb.

{Chorus}
Glory /.ai{to our God on high,
To Him who reigns} over earth and /.ai{sky},
/.ai{And to the Lamb who once was slain,
Forevermore we sing His name!
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,
Blessing and power where glory dwells,}
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,
Unto our God, Yeshua

{Verse 3}
/.ai{Twelve times twelve, the} thousands called,
/.ai{A} righteous /.ai{host} with Him will rule,
/.ai{Clothed in robes of purest light,
Washed in blood, made clean and bright.
Day and night, their song ascends,
A praise that never, never ends,
For He who} created /.ai{with His breath,
Has conquered sin and vanquished death.}

{Chorus}
Glory /.ai{to our God on high,
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,
And to the Lamb who once was slain,
Forevermore we sing His name!
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,
Blessing and power where glory dwells,}
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,
Unto our God, Yeshua

{Verse 4}
The bright Morning Star is coming,
His just reward, He is bringing.
Blessed are those who've washed their robe,
Through the city gate they may go,
And they have been given the right
To eat fruit of the tree of life.
And the Spirit and bride invite
To drink of the water of life.

{Chorus}
Glory /.ai{to our God on high,
To Him who reigns over earth and sky,
And to the Lamb who once was slain,
Forevermore we sing His name!
Amen, amen, the anthem swells,
Blessing and power where glory dwells,}
Deepest praise, thanks and honour,
Unto our God, Yeshua

{Outro}
/.ai{Forevermore, the throne we see,
The Lamb, our Shepherd, sets us free,
With every voice, we join} in praise,
Glory and honour to the Endless of Days!
