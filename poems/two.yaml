          Me plus you, that makes two
          So two we'll be: you plus me.
          What'll we do, us who are two?
          We'll cross the sea, and go to Italy!
          Vino Italiano for me and you.

        lines: |
          What'll be there, how will we fare
          Two who are one, under the Roman sun?
          I know not my dear, but this I'll share:
          No ill will come, where'er we run.
          There's naught to  fear, for we're in the care
          Of Father, Ghost and Son---Three who are One!
          So let's go, let us dare, me with my lady fair.
