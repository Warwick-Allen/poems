      Me plus you, that makes two<br />
          So two we'll be: you plus me.<br />
          What'll we do, us who are two?<br />
          We'll cross the sea, and go to Italy!<br />
          Vino Italiano for me and you.<br />

      What'll be there, how will we fare<br />
          Two who are one, under the Roman sun?<br />
          I know not my dear, but this I'll share:<br />
          No ill will come, where'er we run.<br />
          There's naught to  fear, for we're in the care<br />
          Of Father, Ghost and Son&mdash;Three who are One!<br />
          So let's go, let us dare, me with my lady fair.
