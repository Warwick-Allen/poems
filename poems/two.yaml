      Me plus you, that makes two
      So two we'll be: you plus me.
      What'll we do, us who are two?
      We'll cross the sea, and go to Italy!
      Vino Italiano for me and you.

    lines: |
      What'll be there, how will we fare
      Two who are one, under the Roman sun?
      I know not my dear, but this I'll share:
      No ill will come, where'er we run.
      There's naught to  fear, for we're in the care
      Of Father, Ghost and Son&mdash;Three who are One!
      So let's go, let us dare, me with my lady fair.
