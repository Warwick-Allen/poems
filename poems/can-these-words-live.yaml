          Son of man, can these bones live?
          Oh Lord, Yahweh, You know.
          Prophesy, prophesy, prophesy!

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will put sinews on you,
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make flesh grow on you,
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cover you with skin.
