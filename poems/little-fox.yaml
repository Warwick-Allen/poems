  - lines: |
      The whites in your eyes,
      The dim mirror hides.

  - lines: |
      So close, out of shot;
      So much, not a lot.

  - lines: |
      Let&apos;s talk about this,
      Little fox, my nemesis.

  - lines: |
      The thief is out there.
      The thief is in here.

  - lines: |
      Tell me, who are you?
      I know, already knew.

  - lines: |
      Saw through cheap disguise;
      The soul in your eyes...

  - lines: |
      Is gone, do you miss it?
      But mine, you won&apos;t get it.
      But mine, it&apos;s well kept.
