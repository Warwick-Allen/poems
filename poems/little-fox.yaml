  The whites in your eyes,
  The dim mirror hides.

  So close, out of shot;
  So much, not a lot.

  Let&apos;s talk about this,
  Little fox, my nemesis.

  The thief is out there.
  The thief is in here.

  Tell me, who are you?
  I know, already knew.

  Saw through cheap disguise;
  The soul in your eyes...

  Is gone, do you miss it?
  But mine, you won&apos;t get it.
  But mine, it&apos;s well kept.
