  The whites in your eyes,<br />
  The dim mirror hides.<br />
  <br />
  So close, out of shot;<br />
  So much, not a lot.<br />
  <br />
  Let&apos;s talk about this,<br />
  Little fox, my nemesis.<br />
  <br />
  The thief is out there.<br />
  The thief is in here.<br />
  <br />
  Tell me, who are you?<br />
  I know, already knew.<br />
  <br />
  Saw through cheap disguise;<br />
  The soul in your eyes...<br />
  <br />
  Is gone, do you miss it?<br />
  But mine, you won&apos;t get it.<br />
  But mine, it&apos;s well kept.<br />
