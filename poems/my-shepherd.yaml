  Often I wander
      Often I stray
      From the path You&#39;ve chosen for me
      From Your blessed way

      Often I declare
      My love for You
      Yet that same love I deny
      In the things that I do

      But just when it seems I&#39;ve gone that little too far
      When my will differs from that of Your own
      When Your love isn&#39;t my guiding star
      When I try to go it alone

      You reach out Your hand
      You draw me near
      You wrap Your arms around me
      In a hug so dear

      And I know Your love
      A love so true
      And I wonder why I do
      Those things that don&#39;t please You

      Then You set me back down on my way
      The path that You&#39;d have me journey
      And gently squeeze my hand to say
      &ldquo;Child, all the way&mdash;it&#39;s you and Me.&rdquo;
