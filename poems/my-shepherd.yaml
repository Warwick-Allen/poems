  Often I wander<br />
      Often I stray<br />
      From the path You&#39;ve chosen for me<br />
      From Your blessed way<br />
      <br />
      Often I declare<br />
      My love for You<br />
      Yet that same love I deny<br />
      In the things that I do<br />
      <br />
      But just when it seems I&#39;ve gone that little too far<br />
      When my will differs from that of Your own<br />
      When Your love isn&#39;t my guiding star<br />
      When I try to go it alone<br />
      <br />
      You reach out Your hand<br />
      You draw me near<br />
      You wrap Your arms around me<br />
      In a hug so dear<br />
      <br />
      And I know Your love<br />
      A love so true<br />
      And I wonder why I do<br />
      Those things that don&#39;t please You<br />
      <br />
      Then You set me back down on my way<br />
      The path that You&#39;d have me journey<br />
      And gently squeeze my hand to say<br />
      &ldquo;Child, all the way&mdash;it&#39;s you and Me.&rdquo;<br />
