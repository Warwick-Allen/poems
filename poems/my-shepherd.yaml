          Often I wander
          Often I stray
          From the path You've chosen for me
          From Your blessed way

      - lines: |
          Often I declare
          My love for You
          Yet that same love I deny
          In the things that I do

      - lines: |
          But just when it seems I've gone that little too far
          When my will differs from that of Your own
          When Your love isn't my guiding star
          When I try to go it alone

      - lines: |
          You reach out Your hand
          You draw me near
          You wrap Your arms around me
          In a hug so dear

      - lines: |
          And I know Your love
          A love so true
          And I wonder why I do
          Those things that don't please You

      - lines: |
          Then You set me back down on my way
          The path that You'd have me journey
          And gently squeeze my hand to say
          &ldquo;Child, all the way&mdash;it's you and Me.&rdquo;
