A Word from Me
2005-02-13

I have a word
I have two
I have a thought
A thought of you

My thought is pleasant
My thought is fond
My thought is glad
Of our bond

A thought's a breath
A fleeting dew
A recurring breath
My thought of you

A thought preserved
A thought to hold
A thought of you
I give you now

A small token
A word from me
A preservation
Offered humbly
