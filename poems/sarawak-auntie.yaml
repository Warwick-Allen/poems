      the water is low
      so we push the boats
      the fox, gamey and chewy
      elicits culinary felicity
      so we please our hosts
      with our gluttony
      what do we share
      what commonality
      in Sarawak, here
      up river and cultures apart
      how is it we share
      so much but cultures apart
      I know
      when I see
      my father-mother-brother-sister-uncle-auntie-cousin
      adoring
      the One whom I adore
