          the water is low
          so we push the boats
          the fox, gamey and chewy
          elicits culinary felicity
          so we please our hosts
          with our gluttony
          what do we share
          what commonality
          in Sarawak, here
          up river and cultures apart
          how is it we share
          so much but cultures apart
          I know
          when I see
          my father-mother-brother-sister-uncle-auntie-cousin
          adoring
          the One whom I adore
