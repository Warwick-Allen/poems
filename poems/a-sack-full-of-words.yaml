      A sack full of kittens
      My words
      Rescued
      Come tumbling out
      Falling over each other
      Tripping on themselves
      Emancipated
      Weak
      Uncoordinated
      My words
      Feed them the milk that they need
      Not that they deserve
      Feed them with meat
      To make them grow
      My words
      The Lion&apos;s roar
      Will be heard
