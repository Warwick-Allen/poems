          A sack full of kittens
          My words
          Rescued
          Come tumbling out
          Falling over each other
          Tripping on themselves
          Emancipated
          Weak
          Uncoordinated
          My words
          Feed them the milk that they need
          Not that they deserve
          Feed them with meat
          To make them grow
          My words
          The Lion's roar
          Will be heard
