  A sack full of kittens<br />
  My words<br />
  Rescued<br />
  Come tumbling out<br />
  Falling over each other<br />
  Tripping on themselves<br />
  Emancipated<br />
  Weak<br />
  Uncoordinated<br />
  My words<br />
  Feed them the milk that they need<br />
  Not that they deserve<br />
  Feed them with meat<br />
  To make them grow<br />
  My words<br />
  The Lion&apos;s roar<br />
  Will be heard<br />
