Romantic Dreams
2000-12-10

Ah, the downfall of the romantic:
When fanciful dreaming strays far from reality
And returns with empty promises---
Gains that are really losses.

O, but what a refreshing tonic,
To fly on the wings of fantasy,
From time to time,
Uplifting for soul and mind.

But remember it's also good,
Or so I've found,
To keep at least one foot
On the ground.
