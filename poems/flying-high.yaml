    lines: |
      The eagle it soars, with such might<br />
          Above the clouds in noble flight<br />
          And it does, from that lofty height<br />
          To the ground below cast its sight<br />
  - label: "[Verse 2]"
    lines: |
      On the creatures down low it stares<br />
          With scorn and derision it sneers<br />
          To itself and what ever hears<br />
          And with bitter contempt declares:<br />
  - label: "[Verse 3]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;Shame to all those birds low flying<br />
          Sparrows, finches, all those choosing<br />
          Low to stay, near the ground to sing<br />
          And never actually trying<br />
  - label: "[Verse 4]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;For if their wings they would bother<br />
          To stretch that little bit wider<br />
          Set their sights a little higher<br />
          And try that little bit harder<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 1]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;They too might know<br />
          The glory and the majesty<br />
          Of flying high<br />
  - label: "[Verse 5]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;&apos;Twas not without effort that I<br />
          Managed to climb so very high<br />
          My wings I did spread wide, and my<br />
          Sights I did set high in the sky<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 2]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;It&apos;s through my own efforts that I know<br />
          The glory and the majesty<br />
          Of flying high<br />
  - label: "[Verse 6]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;As for those creatures who must stay<br />
          On the earth forever as they<br />
          Have no feathers, no wings, no way<br />
          Of flying. Pity them, I say<br />
  - label: "[Verse 7]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;But it&apos;s the ground fowl I can&apos;t stand<br />
          He has wings, as I understand<br />
          Feathers too, but he dwells on land<br />
          Not in the sky, so high and grand<br />
  - label: "[Verse 8]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;Why does he choose this way to live<br />
          When the blue skies he could have if<br />
          His wings he would flap, and then, with<br />
          Some effort, the skies would be his<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 3]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;And then he too might know<br />
          The glory and the majesty<br />
          Of flying high<br />
  - label: "[Verse 9]"
    lines: |
      &ldquo;But no, he makes a decision<br />
          To live in humiliation<br />
          And shame; an abomination<br />
          To all the birds of creation<br />

    lines: |
      &ldquo;If only he tried<br />
          Oh, how I loathe the ground fowl.&rdquo;
