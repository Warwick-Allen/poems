        lines: |
          The eagle it soars, with such might
          Above the clouds in noble flight
          And it does, from that lofty height
          To the ground below cast its sight

      - label: "[Verse 2]"
        lines: |
          On the creatures down low it stares
          With scorn and derision it sneers
          To itself and what ever hears
          And with bitter contempt declares:
      - label: "[Verse 3]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;Shame to all those birds low flying
          Sparrows, finches, all those choosing
          Low to stay, near the ground to sing
          And never actually trying

      - label: "[Verse 4]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;For if their wings they would bother
          To stretch that little bit wider
          Set their sights a little higher
          And try that little bit harder

      - label: "[Chorus 1]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;They too might know
          The glory and the majesty
          Of flying high

      - label: "[Verse 5]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;'Twas not without effort that I
          Managed to climb so very high
          My wings I did spread wide, and my
          Sights I did set high in the sky

      - label: "[Chorus 2]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;It's through my own efforts that I know
          The glory and the majesty
          Of flying high

      - label: "[Verse 6]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;As for those creatures who must stay
          On the earth forever as they
          Have no feathers, no wings, no way
          Of flying. Pity them, I say

      - label: "[Verse 7]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;But it's the ground fowl I can't stand
          He has wings, as I understand
          Feathers too, but he dwells on land
          Not in the sky, so high and grand

      - label: "[Verse 8]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;Why does he choose this way to live
          When the blue skies he could have if
          His wings he would flap, and then, with
          Some effort, the skies would be his

      - label: "[Chorus 3]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;And then he too might know
          The glory and the majesty
          Of flying high

      - label: "[Verse 9]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;But no, he makes a decision
          To live in humiliation
          And shame; an abomination
          To all the birds of creation

      - label: "[Coda]"
        lines: |
          &ldquo;If only he tried
          Oh, how I loathe the ground fowl.&rdquo;
