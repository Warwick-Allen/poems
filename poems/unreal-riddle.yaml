    <h2>Analysis of <em>Unreal Riddle</em> (song arrangement)</h2>
        <h3 id="introduction--unreal-riddle">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; presents an exploration of psychological
          confinement and the paradoxical nature of self-constructed mental prisons.
          The song operates as a metaphysical meditation on the relationship between
          perception, reality, and personal agency, employing the central metaphor
          of blood-written words upon an imaginary wall to examine themes of guilt,
          isolation, and epistemic uncertainty.
        </p>
        <h3 id="central-metaphor-and-symbolism--unreal-riddle">Central Metaphor and Symbolism</h3>
        <p>
          The dominant metaphor of the wall inscribed with blood serves multiple
          symbolic functions throughout the piece. The wall represents psychological
          barriers&mdash;both protective and imprisoning&mdash;that the speaker has
          constructed within their own mind. The blood, repeatedly emphasised as
          &quot;not real&quot; yet paradoxically present, embodies the complex
          relationship between imagined and experienced trauma. This duality
          reflects the genuine psychological impact of mental constructs, even when
          recognised as illusory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase &quot;writing on the wall&quot; invokes biblical connotations
          of divine judgment and prophecy, yet here it becomes deeply personal and
          self-authored. The speaker&#39;s identification as the &quot;guilty
          artist&quot; transforms them from passive recipient of judgment to active
          creator of their own psychological torment, raising questions about
          culpability and self-determination.
        </p>
        <h3 id="structure-and-repetition--unreal-riddle">Structure and Repetition</h3>
        <p>
          The song&#39;s structure reinforces its thematic content through cyclical
          repetition. The recurring pre-chorus &quot;I think, I don&#39;t know&quot;
          encapsulates the speaker&#39;s epistemic crisis&mdash;the fundamental
          uncertainty about their own mental processes and agency. This phrase
          becomes increasingly significant as it appears throughout, suggesting a
          mind caught between rational analysis and emotional confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The repetitive nature of the chorus creates a sense of being trapped
          within a loop, mirroring the psychological imprisonment described in the
          lyrics. The escalating repetition in the outro (&quot;I think, I
          think&hellip;&quot;) suggests either mounting anxiety or the mechanical
          nature of obsessive thought patterns.
        </p>
        <h3 id="progression-of-self-understanding--unreal-riddle">
          Progression of Self-Understanding
        </h3>
        <p>
          The five verses trace a journey of gradual, though incomplete,
          self-awareness. The progression moves from initial confusion (&quot;their
          meaning I can&#39;t grasp&quot;) through growing recognition of personal
          responsibility (&quot;I built the wall, my cloister&quot;) to final
          questioning of agency (&quot;Could it really be me who&#39;s written those
          dread words?&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          This arc reflects the complex process of psychological insight, where
          understanding one&#39;s role in creating mental suffering doesn&#39;t
          necessarily lead to liberation from it. The speaker&#39;s growing
          awareness paradoxically increases their uncertainty, suggesting that
          self-knowledge can be as imprisoning as ignorance.
        </p>
        <h3 id="language-and-tone--unreal-riddle">Language and Tone</h3>
        <p>
          The vocabulary choices create a gothic, almost medieval atmosphere through
          words like &quot;cloister,&quot; &quot;confine,&quot; and
          &quot;captivity.&quot; This linguistic register elevates the speaker&#39;s
          internal struggle to the level of epic or religious drama, whilst
          simultaneously suggesting monastic isolation and penitential suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The juxtaposition of concrete imagery (&quot;blood,&quot;
          &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;words&quot;) with assertions of unreality creates
          cognitive dissonance that mirrors the speaker&#39;s psychological state.
          This tension between the tangible and intangible reflects broader
          philosophical questions about the nature of mental experience.
        </p>
        <h3 id="themes-of-agency-and-responsibility--unreal-riddle">
          Themes of Agency and Responsibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          Central to the song is the paradox of self-authored suffering. The speaker
          simultaneously claims authorship (&quot;I am the guilty artist&quot;) and
          questions their agency (&quot;Was this really my choice here?&quot;). This
          reflects the complex relationship between conscious will and psychological
          compulsion, particularly relevant to understanding depression, anxiety,
          and other mental health conditions where individuals may feel responsible
          for thoughts and feelings beyond their direct control.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wall&#39;s dual nature&mdash;as both &quot;safehold&quot; and
          prison&mdash;illustrates how psychological defences can become
          self-defeating. The protection from the &quot;harsh wind of reality&quot;
          comes at the cost of genuine freedom, suggesting the difficult balance
          between necessary psychological boundaries and self-imposed limitations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="philosophical-implications--unreal-riddle">Philosophical Implications</h3>
        <p>
          The song engages with fundamental questions about the nature of reality
          and mental experience. The assertion that imagined constructs can have
          real effects (&quot;My thoughts give the wall substance&quot;) touches on
          phenomenological philosophy and the reality of subjective experience. The
          speaker&#39;s situation exemplifies how mental constructs, even when
          recognised as constructs, retain their power to affect behaviour and
          emotion.
        </p>
        <h3 id="conclusion--unreal-riddle">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          &quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; succeeds as both a psychological portrait and
          philosophical meditation. Its strength lies in its refusal to offer simple
          resolutions to complex mental states. The speaker&#39;s journey towards
          self-understanding doesn&#39;t culminate in liberation but in deeper
          recognition of their paradoxical situation. The song&#39;s power derives
          from its honest depiction of how self-awareness can coexist with continued
          psychological entrapment, making it a particularly nuanced exploration of
          mental imprisonment and the elusive nature of personal freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work ultimately suggests that understanding the mechanisms of our
          psychological prisons may be a necessary first step towards freedom, even
          if that understanding doesn&#39;t immediately provide the key to escape.
          In this way, the &quot;riddle&quot; of the title remains appropriately
          unsolved, reflecting the ongoing nature of psychological struggle and
          self-discovery.
