  I am given silver<br />
      But I want pewter<br />
      <br />
      I have gold but yet<br />
      I yearn for brass<br />
      <br />
      And quartz it seems I prefer<br />
      To my diamonds with their glitter<br />
      <br />
      And all my pearls I forgot<br />
      As I long for a piece of broken glass<br />
