          I am given silver
          But I want pewter
      - lines: |
          I have gold but yet
          I yearn for brass
      - lines: |
          And quartz it seems I prefer
          To my diamonds with their glitter
      - lines: |
          And all my pearls I forgot
          As I long for a piece of broken glass
