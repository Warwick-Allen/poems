  I have a word
  I have two
  I have a thought
  A thought of you

  My thought is pleasant
  My thought is fond
  My thought is glad
  Of our bond

  A thought&apos;s a breath
  A fleeting dew
  A recurring breath
  My thought of you

  A thought preserved
  A thought to hold
  A thought of you
  I give you now

  A small token
  A word from me
  A preservation
  Offered humbly
