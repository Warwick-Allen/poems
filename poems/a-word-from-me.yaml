        I have a word
        I have two
        I have a thought
        A thought of you

    - lines: |
        My thought is pleasant
        My thought is fond
        My thought is glad
        Of our bond

    - lines: |
        A thought's a breath
        A fleeting dew
        A recurring breath
        My thought of you

    - lines: |
        A thought preserved
        A thought to hold
        A thought of you
        I give you now

    - lines: |
        A small token
        A word from me
        A preservation
        Offered humbly
