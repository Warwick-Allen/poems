  I have a word<br />
  I have two<br />
  I have a thought<br />
  A thought of you<br />
  <br />
  My thought is pleasant<br />
  My thought is fond<br />
  My thought is glad<br />
  Of our bond<br />
  <br />
  A thought&apos;s a breath<br />
  A fleeting dew<br />
  A recurring breath<br />
  My thought of you<br />
  <br />
  A thought preserved<br />
  A thought to hold<br />
  A thought of you<br />
  I give you now<br />
  <br />
  A small token<br />
  A word from me<br />
  A preservation<br />
  Offered humbly<br />
