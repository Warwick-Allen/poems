      - label: Verse 1
        lines: |
          Let me tell a story of a valley, verdant,
          Green and lush and abundant.
          Down the valley flowed so clear&mdash;a stream
          From which life did flourish, life did teem.

      - label: Verse 2
        lines: |
          Now in this valley a wall was made;
          'Twas built so the stream it dammed, the water it stayed.
          And long stood the wall, so crude and rough;
          Poorly built, but seeming sturdy enough.

      - label: Verse 3
        lines: |
          It was I that built the wall, the water to hold,
          To save my feet&mdash;ever wet, ever cold.
          So stones I found, stones I gathered, stones I laid;
          Over many years, a dam I made.

      - label: Verse 4
        lines: |
          At first, a small wall sufficed to stop the creek,
          But soon enough, over the top, water began to trickle and leak.
          So to enlarge the wall I laboured hard, I laboured long,
          Eventually having before me a dam, imposing and strong.

      - label: Verse 5
        lines: |
          Then the valley below the dam became dry and torrid;
          The water that once gave it life had been contained or diverted.
          In time, what had been green and lush became dry and empty,
          And I was thirsty.  O, how I was thirsty.

      - label: Verse 6
        lines: |
          My desire for the life-giving water became a desperate aching,
          So stones I started pulling, the dam I started breaking.
          Then, to my delight, water came rushing through the hole I'd created.
          I drank, and it was good.  I drank, and I was elated.

      - label: Verse 7
        lines: |
          Very soon, yes&mdash;it was almost immediately, cracks appeared
          In the dam, around the hole I had cleared.
          The cracks grew and, by the power of water repressed, the dam was rent;
          Water flooded through the breach in an unstoppable torrent.

      - label: Verse 8
        lines: |
          All I can do now is desperately clutch the stones,
          But I feel my grip weakening.
