      Let me tell a story of a valley, verdant,<br />
          Green and lush and abundant.<br />
          Down the valley flowed so clear&mdash;a stream<br />
          From which life did flourish, life did teem.<br />

    lines: |
      Now in this valley a wall was made;<br />
          &apos;Twas built so the stream it dammed, the water it stayed.<br />
          And long stood the wall, so crude and rough;<br />
          Poorly built, but seeming sturdy enough.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 3]"
    lines: |
      It was I that built the wall, the water to hold,<br />
          To save my feet&mdash;ever wet, ever cold.<br />
          So stones I found, stones I gathered, stones I laid;<br />
          Over many years, a dam I made.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 4]"
    lines: |
      At first, a small wall sufficed to stop the creek,<br />
          But soon enough, over the top, water began to trickle and leak.<br />
          So to enlarge the wall I laboured hard, I laboured long,<br />
          Eventually having before me a dam, imposing and strong.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 5]"
    lines: |
      Then the valley below the dam became dry and torrid;<br />
          The water that once gave it life had been contained or diverted.<br />
          In time, what had been green and lush became dry and empty,<br />
          And I was thirsty.  O, how I was thirsty.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 6]"
    lines: |
      My desire for the life-giving water became a desperate aching,<br />
          So stones I started pulling, the dam I started breaking.<br />
          Then, to my delight, water came rushing through the hole I&apos;d created.<br />
          I drank, and it was good.  I drank, and I was elated.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 7]"
    lines: |
      Very soon, yes&mdash;it was almost immediately, cracks appeared<br />
          In the dam, around the hole I had cleared.<br />
          The cracks grew and, by the power of water repressed, the dam was rent;<br />
          Water flooded through the breach in an unstoppable torrent.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 8]"
    lines: |
      All I can do now is desperately clutch the stones,<br />
          But I feel my grip weakening.
