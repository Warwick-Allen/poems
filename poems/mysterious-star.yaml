          Upon the starts I gaze
          Into the heavens I stare
          I find some comfort there
          Though star seem so far away

      - lines: |
          I've been here for sometime
          Staring, watching, waiting
          Praying, always hoping
          A bright star might be mine

      - lines: |
          Past me, sometimes, a star will fly
          A beautiful, radiant shooting star
          Travelling by me not so far
          For my heart to singe as it passes by

      - lines: |
          I see a new star now coming towards me
          From the others, somehow different
          More intensely radiant
          With a light greater than its own, for all to see

      - lines: |
          With that light, I'm quite familiar
          That holy, pure light
          Potent enough to pierce the darkest night
          My heart this light does lure

      - lines: |
          Never before has a star of this nature
          Glowing with holy radiance
          Shinning with natural brilliance
          Never before has one come so near

      - lines: |
          Will this star come close enough for harm
          Burn my soul and then depart
          Fly harmlessly into the distance, or crash into my heart
          Or float like a butterfly into my arms
