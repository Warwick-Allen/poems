  Upon the starts I gaze<br />
      Into the heavens I stare<br />
      I find some comfort there<br />
      Though star seem so far away<br />
      <br />
      I&#39;ve been here for sometime<br />
      Staring, watching, waiting<br />
      Praying, always hoping<br />
      A bright star might be mine<br />
      <br />
      Past me, sometimes, a star will fly<br />
      A beautiful, radiant shooting star<br />
      Travelling by me not so far<br />
      For my heart to singe as it passes by<br />
      <br />
      I see a new star now coming towards me<br />
      From the others, somehow different<br />
      More intensely radiant<br />
      With a light greater than its own, for all to see<br />
      <br />
      With that light, I&#39;m quite familiar<br />
      That holy, pure light<br />
      Potent enough to pierce the darkest night<br />
      My heart this light does lure<br />
      <br />
      Never before has a star of this nature<br />
      Glowing with holy radiance<br />
      Shinning with natural brilliance<br />
      Never before has one come so near<br />
      <br />
      Will this star come close enough for harm<br />
      Burn my soul and then depart<br />
      Fly harmlessly into the distance, or crash into my heart<br />
      Or float like a butterfly into my arms<br />
