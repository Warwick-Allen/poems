  Lord, I want to serve You.<br />
      How I wish I were able,<br />
      And capable, and ready.<br />
      I know they say that it doesn&apos;t matter,<br />
      That You can use me anyway.<br />
      I guess that my feeble mind<br />
      Has trouble comprehending that fact.<br />
      Please, Lord,<br />
      Make me an &ldquo;amazing man of God&rdquo;.<br />
