          Lord, I want to serve You.
          How I wish I were able,
          And capable, and ready.
          I know they say that it doesn't matter,
          That You can use me anyway.
          I guess that my feeble mind
          Has trouble comprehending that fact.
          Please, Lord,
          Make me an &ldquo;amazing man of God&rdquo;.
