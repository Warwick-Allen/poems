  How wonderful to listen
  To that minstrel of summer
  What sweeter sound to bask in
  Than the song of the cicada?

  Never-failing evangelist
  Faithful herald of the sun
  &ldquo;Foul weather is banquished&rdquo;
  Announces cicada's hum

  Don't go quiet on me
  Keep singing little friend
  Keep humming in your tree
  Don't let the summer end
