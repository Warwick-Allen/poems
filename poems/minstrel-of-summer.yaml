  How wonderful to listen<br />
  To that minstrel of summer<br />
  What sweeter sound to bask in<br />
  Than the song of the cicada?<br />
  <br />
  Never-failing evangelist<br />
  Faithful herald of the sun<br />
  &ldquo;Foul weather is banquished&rdquo;<br />
  Announces cicada's hum<br />
  <br />
  Don't go quiet on me<br />
  Keep singing little friend<br />
  Keep humming in your tree<br />
  Don't let the summer end<br />
