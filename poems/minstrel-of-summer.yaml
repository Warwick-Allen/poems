          How wonderful to listen
          To that minstrel of summer
          What sweeter sound to bask in
          Than the song of the cicada?

      - lines: |
          Never-failing evangelist
          Faithful herald of the sun
          &ldquo;Foul weather is banquished&rdquo;
          Announces cicada's hum

      - lines: |
          Don't go quiet on me
          Keep singing little friend
          Keep humming in your tree
          Don't let the summer end
