    lines: |
      My love, o, see my love.<br />
          It's feeble, not enough,<br />
          Strong in thought, weak in deed,<br />
          It is not all you need.<br />
          It's all I have. It's true.<br />
          My love, it's all for you.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus]"
    lines: |
      Through the grief and the pain,<br />
          Through loss in place of gain,<br />
          Through the valley, dark and long,<br />
          My love is my quiet song.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 2]"
    lines: |
      My love, my true desire,<br />
          You, dear, raise me higher<br />
          Than what I could've known<br />
          Doing life on my own.<br />
          You're who I need, it's true,<br />
          I'm better because of you.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus]"
    lines: |
      Through the grief and the pain,<br />
          Through loss in place of gain,<br />
          Through the valley, dark and long,<br />
          My love is my quiet song.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 3]"
    lines: |
      Sometimes hidden and silent,<br />
          My love's never absent,<br />
          My love, weak and wanting,<br />
          Your needs not meeting.<br />
          In my weakness, it's true,<br />
          I strive to serve you.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus]"
    lines: |
      Through the grief and the pain,<br />
          Through loss in place of gain,<br />

          My love is my quiet song.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 4]"
    lines: |
      One thing you know, my dear,<br />
          I'm not going anywhere.<br />
          Blessed through all life's strife<br />
          By my beautiful wife.<br />
          My eyes, they're always true,<br />
          My heart, it's just for you.<br />

          My love is my quiet song.<br />

    lines: |
      We, together, two lie;<br />
          We, together, have heat.<br />
          We on the Lord rely;<br />
          Three, then, won't be beat.<br />
          We, a cord of three strands;<br />
          We, in Him, can stand.<br />
