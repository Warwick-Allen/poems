      - label: Verse 1
        lines: |
          My love, o, see my love.
          It's feeble, not enough,
          Strong in thought, weak in deed,
          It is not all you need.
          It's all I have. It's true.
          My love, it's all for you.

      - label: Chorus
        lines: |
          Through the grief and the pain,
          Through loss in place of gain,
          Through the valley, dark and long,
          My love is my quiet song.

      - label: Verse 2
        lines: |
          My love, my true desire,
          You, dear, raise me higher
          Than what I could've known
          Doing life on my own.
          You're who I need, it's true,
          I'm better because of you.

      - label: Chorus
        lines: |
          Through the grief and the pain,
          Through loss in place of gain,
          Through the valley, dark and long,
          My love is my quiet song.

      - label: Verse 3
        lines: |
          Sometimes hidden and silent,
          My love's never absent,
          My love, weak and wanting,
          Your needs not meeting.
          In my weakness, it's true,
          I strive to serve you.

      - label: Chorus
        lines: |
          Through the grief and the pain,
          Through loss in place of gain,
          Through the valley, dark and long,
          My love is my quiet song.

      - label: Verse 4
        lines: |
          One thing you know, my dear,
          I'm not going anywhere.
          Blessed through all life's strife
          By my beautiful wife.
          My eyes, they're always true,
          My heart, it's just for you.

      - label: Chorus
        lines: |
          Through the grief and the pain,
          Through loss in place of gain,
          Through the valley, dark and long,
          My love is my quiet song.

      - label: Coda
        lines: |
          We, together, two lie;
          We, together, have heat.
          We on the Lord rely;
          Three, then, won't be beat.
          We, a cord of three strands;
          We, in Him, can stand.
