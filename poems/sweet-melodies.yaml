          love notes of sweet melodies
          shoot from deep-green leaves
          swayed by gentle breeze
          tenderly caressing me
          snuggling into the sun
          a lullaby softly hummed
          innocence fills my lungs
          a thousand yesterdays
          cleansed with sea spray
          exhaled and put away
          sweep the floor of today
          space for my soul to play
