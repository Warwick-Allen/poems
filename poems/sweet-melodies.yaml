  love notes of sweet melodies<br />
  shoot from deep-green leaves<br />
  swayed by gentle breeze<br />
  tenderly caressing me<br />
  snuggling into the sun<br />
  a lullaby softly hummed<br />
  innocence fills my lungs<br />
  a thousand yesterdays<br />
  cleansed with sea spray<br />
  exhaled and put away<br />
  sweep the floor of today<br />
  space for my soul to play<br />
