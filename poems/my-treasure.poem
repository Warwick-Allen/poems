My Treasure
2015-03-26

I see you still
in the squall
in the still
through it all

I hold you still
Sure you know
Never will
Let you go

Love you my Love
Ever do
All my love
Always you

Not faltering
My desire
Soul yearning
My treasure

You still hold me
Don't let it
Be loosely
Loose to slip

Us together
Always is
Forever
How it is

Future bright'ning
We walk on
Love strength'ning
We are strong

Love is strong
