      <span class="ai">From every nation, tribe, and tongue,<br />
      A multitude in white has come,<br />
      Before the throne, their voices ring,<br />
      To God and Lamb, their praise they bring.<br />
      Sealed by grace, the chosen stand,<br />
      Marked by heaven&apos;s holy hand,<br />
      Through tribulation&apos;s darkened tide,<br />
      They rise to glory at His side.</span><br />
  - label: "[Chorus]"
    lines: |
      Glory <span class="ai">to our God on high,<br />
      To Him who reigns</span> over earth and <span class="ai">sky</span>,<br />
      <span class="ai">And to the Lamb who once was slain,<br />
      Forevermore we sing His name!<br />
      Amen, amen, the anthem swells,<br />
      Blessing and power where glory dwells,</span><br />
      Deepest praise, thanks and honour,<br />
      Unto our God, Yeshua<br />
      <br />
      <span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span> <br />
      <span class="ai">The angels bow, the elders fall,<br />
      A mighty chorus fills the hall,<br />
      The One who sits upon the throne,<br />
      Has called His own to</span> their home.<br />
      <span class="ai">No hunger now, no thirst to bear,</span><br />
      Their God <span class="ai">will</span> dry their every tear,<br />
      <span class="ai">By living springs of joy they stand,</span><br />
      In the majesty of the Lamb. <br />

      <span class="ai">Twelve times twelve, the</span> thousands called,<br />
      <span class="ai">A</span> righteous <span class="ai">host</span> with Him will rule,<br />
      <span class="ai">Clothed in robes of purest light,<br />
      Washed in blood, made clean and bright.<br />
      Day and night, their song ascends,<br />
      A praise that never, never ends,<br />
      For He who</span> created <span class="ai">with His breath,<br />
      Has conquered sin and vanquished death.</span><br />

      <span class="song-segment">[Verse 4]</span> <br />
      The bright Morning Star is coming,<br />
      His just reward, He is bringing.<br />
      Blessed are those who&apos;ve washed their robe,<br />
      Through the city gate they may go,<br />
      And they have been given the right<br />
      To eat fruit of the tree of life.<br />
      And the Spirit and bride invite<br />
      To drink of the water of life.<br />

      Glory and honour to the Endless of Days!
