Dimly-Lit Path
2022-02-01

Eggshells narrowly escape
feet awkwardly crash between
And the load shouldered
precious, fragile, teetering

New terrain, strangely familiar
strange turns
through pit holes and trenches
gradually climbing

A torch for the feet
a necessary comfort
The direction unknown
just press on up

The terrain is rugged
But the load shouldered
precious, fragile, balanced
Is not shouldered alone
