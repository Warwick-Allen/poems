      - label: Verse 1
        lines: |
          What have You done for me?
          Merely given me a life worth living,
          Shown me love to which none can compare,
          A hope of a future, amazing and exciting.
          You've given me this, for free.

      - label: Chorus 1
        lines: |
          Should I be grateful?
          Should I show it?
          Should I fervently praise You,
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth?

      - label: Verse 2
        lines: |
          After all, You only sent Your Son
          To die in sheer agony,
          To be cut off from Your love,
          To be crushed by the weight of my sin,
          So that I might know You, and live.

      - label: Chorus 2
        lines: |
          You'd think I'd be grateful.
          You'd think I'd want to show it.
          You'd think I'd fervently praise You,
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.

      - label: Verse 3
        lines: |
          What act of gratitude would be worthy
          To give thanks for what You have done?
          Nothing, really, but I could make a start,
          Such as giving You all that I have and all that I am,
          And living Your will in all that I do.

      - label: Chorus 3
        lines: |
          Father, I am grateful,
          And I want to show it.
          I shall fervently praise You,
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.

      - label: Verse 4
        lines: |
          If giving You my life and living Your will
          Were the least that I could do,
          You'd think that I'd manage that.
          But no, I fail, I let You down.
          Sometimes I think I'm more of a hindrance than a help to Your kingdom.

      - label: Chorus 4
        lines: |
          Lord, I am grateful;
          Help me to show it.
          Teach me to fervently praise You,
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.

      - label: Verse 5
        lines: |
          Thank You, Father, for Your grace,
          And for Your infinitely patient love.
          Thank You that whenever I fall,
          You catch me and comfort me with Your tender presence,
          And You're always ready to forgive.
