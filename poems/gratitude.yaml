      What have You done for me?<br />
          Merely given me a life worth living,<br />
          Shown me love to which none can compare,<br />
          A hope of a future, amazing and exciting.<br />
          You've given me this, for free.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 1]"
    lines: |
      Should I be grateful?<br />
          Should I show it?<br />
          Should I fervently praise You,<br />
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth?<br />
  - label: "[Verse 2]"
    lines: |
      After all, You only sent Your Son<br />
          To die in sheer agony,<br />
          To be cut off from Your love,<br />
          To be crushed by the weight of my sin,<br />
          So that I might know You, and live.<br />

    lines: |
      You'd think I'd be grateful.<br />
          You'd think I'd want to show it.<br />
          You'd think I'd fervently praise You,<br />
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />

    lines: |
      What act of gratitude would be worthy<br />
          To give thanks for what You have done?<br />
          Nothing, really, but I could make a start,<br />
          Such as giving You all that I have and all that I am,<br />
          And living Your will in all that I do.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 3]"
    lines: |
      Father, I am grateful,<br />
          And I want to show it.<br />
          I shall fervently praise You,<br />
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 4]"
    lines: |
      If giving You my life and living Your will<br />
          Were the least that I could do,<br />
          You'd think that I'd manage that.<br />
          But no, I fail, I let You down.<br />
          Sometimes I think I'm more of a hindrance than a help to Your kingdom.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 4]"
    lines: |
      Lord, I am grateful;<br />
          Help me to show it.<br />
          Teach me to fervently praise You,<br />
          And proclaim Your name to the ends of the earth.<br />
  - label: "[Verse 5]"
    lines: |
      Thank You, Father, for Your grace,<br />
          And for Your infinitely patient love.<br />
          Thank You that whenever I fall,<br />
          You catch me and comfort me with Your tender presence,<br />
          And You're always ready to forgive.
