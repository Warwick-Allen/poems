    lines: |
      I&apos;m weary, and my all is not enough,<br />
      And the road ahead stretches long and rough.<br />
      <span class="ai">I&apos;m</span> kneeling, empty, <span class="ai">nothing left to give,</span><br />
      Here, <span class="ai">in surrender, I begin to live.</span><br />
  - label: "[Chorus 1]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
      When it&apos;s no longer I, but He who lives in me,<br />
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
      <span class="ai">He lifts me up</span> and <span class="ai">He carries me.</span><br />
  - label: "[Verse 2]"
    lines: |
      In front of me, tasks beyond my might, <br />
      <span class="ai">And every step,</span> a battle and a fight.<br />
      <span class="ai">I&apos;m lost in the struggle, but</span> in this place,<br />
      I rest in His mercy, and in His grace.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 2]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
      <span class="ai">In the breaking of my pride, His mercy reigns.</span><br />
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
      <span class="ai">He holds me close, through every storm and pain.</span><br />
  - label: "[Verse 3]"
    lines: |
      All I have to offer is tears and loss,<br />
      So I fall before the redeeming cross.<br />
      His strength is perfect when I know my weakness.<br />
      <span class="ai">In</span> knowing my emptiness, <span class="ai">I find His</span> fullness.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 3]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
      <span class="ai">In the stillness of surrender,</span> He will <span class="ai">sustain.</span><br />
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
      Through it all, His grace and power remain.<br />
  - label: "[Bridge]"
    lines: |
      When my race is run,<br />
      His has just begun.<br />
      When I am undone,<br />
      I rest in the Son.<br />
  - label: "[Chorus 4]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
      <span class="ai">In the ashes of my plans, His hope remains.</span><br />
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
      So here I rest, <span class="ai">in the power of His name.</span><br />

    lines: |
      He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<br />
      He leadeth me beside the still waters.<br />
      He restoreth my soul:<br />
      He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness<br />
      for his name&apos;s sake.
