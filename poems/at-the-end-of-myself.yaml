    lines: |
      I&apos;m weary, and my all is not enough,
      And the road ahead stretches long and rough.
      <span class="ai">I&apos;m</span> kneeling, empty, <span class="ai">nothing left to give,</span>
      Here, <span class="ai">in surrender, I begin to live.</span>

  - label: "[Chorus 1]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
      When it&apos;s no longer I, but He who lives in me,
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
      <span class="ai">He lifts me up</span> and <span class="ai">He carries me.</span>

  - label: "[Verse 2]"
    lines: |
      In front of me, tasks beyond my might,
      <span class="ai">And every step,</span> a battle and a fight.
      <span class="ai">I&apos;m lost in the struggle, but</span> in this place,
      I rest in His mercy, and in His grace.

  - label: "[Chorus 2]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
      <span class="ai">In the breaking of my pride, His mercy reigns.</span>
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
      <span class="ai">He holds me close, through every storm and pain.</span>

  - label: "[Verse 3]"
    lines: |
      All I have to offer is tears and loss,
      So I fall before the redeeming cross.
      His strength is perfect when I know my weakness.
      <span class="ai">In</span> knowing my emptiness, <span class="ai">I find His</span> fullness.

  - label: "[Chorus 3]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
      <span class="ai">In the stillness of surrender,</span> He will <span class="ai">sustain.</span>
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
      Through it all, His grace and power remain.

    lines: |
      When my race is run,
      His has just begun.
      When I am undone,
      I rest in the Son.

  - label: "[Chorus 4]"
    lines: |
      At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.
      <span class="ai">In the ashes of my plans, His hope remains.</span>
      I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.
      So here I rest, <span class="ai">in the power of His name.</span>

    lines: |
      He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
      He leadeth me beside the still waters.
      He restoreth my soul:
      He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
      for his name&apos;s sake.
