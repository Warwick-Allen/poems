  Who said that this would happen?<br />
      Who dictated that life would<br />
      Become as it had once been?<br />
      <br />
      This is not what is written for me<br />
      In the Book<br />
      I am more<br />
      Well, I can be more<br />
      Than this<br />
      <br />
      I am somebody<br />
      More than that<br />
      I am a child of God<br />
      A servant of the Almighty<br />
      <br />
      He has plans for me<br />
      This I must remember<br />
      Always<br />
