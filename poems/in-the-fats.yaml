  Who said that this would happen?
      Who dictated that life would
      Become as it had once been?

      This is not what is written for me
      In the Book
      I am more
      Well, I can be more
      Than this

      I am somebody
      More than that
      I am a child of God
      A servant of the Almighty

      He has plans for me
      This I must remember
      Always
