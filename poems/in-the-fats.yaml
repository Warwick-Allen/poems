          Who said that this would happen?
          Who dictated that life would
          Become as it had once been?

          This is not what is written for me
          In the Book
          I am more
          Well, I can be more
          Than this

      - lines: |
          I am somebody
          More than that
          I am a child of God
          A servant of the Almighty

          This I must remember
          Always
