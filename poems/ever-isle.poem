Ever Isle
2015-10-18

Every day I breathe a while
Throw my thoughts on a pile
Up there on the top
My dream of Ever Isle

Every day I run a while
Chasing an ephemeral smile
Many-coloured gold-in-pot
My dream of Ever Isle

Every day I stop a while
Resting with easy smile
I know what I've got
My life in Ever Isle
