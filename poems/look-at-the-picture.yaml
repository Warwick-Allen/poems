          look at the picture
          whom do you see
          is it you
          is it me
          a slice of
          &nbsp; humanity

      - lines: |
          look at the picture
          whom do you see
          is it you
          is it He
          a slice of
          &nbsp; divinity

      - lines: |
          odd is the picture
          laid out here now
          it is mixed
          far too mixed
          not as it
          &nbsp; it should be

      - lines: |
          that day of despair
          we wanted to see
          truth was lost
          truth was won
          won back at
          &nbsp; Calvery

      - lines: |
          look at the picture
          sprinkled with Blood
          it was you
          now it's He
          Dad sees His
          &nbsp; purity

      - lines: |
          beautiful's the picture
          our Dad does see
          sin is hid
          taken away
          it is rid
          &nbsp; eternally

      - lines: |
          beautiful's the picture
          we strain to see
          is it true
          could it be
          us restored
          &nbsp; completely
