  look at the picture
  whom do you see
  is it you
  is it me
  a slice of
  &nbsp; humanity

  look at the picture
  whom do you see
  is it you
  is it He
  a slice of
  &nbsp; divinity

  odd is the picture
  laid out here now
  it is mixed
  far too mixed
  not as it
  &nbsp; it should be

  that day of despair
  we wanted to see
  truth was lost
  truth was won
  won back at
  &nbsp; Calvery

  look at the picture
  sprinkled with Blood
  it was you
  now it&apos;s He
  Dad sees His
  &nbsp; purity

  beautiful&apos;s the picture
  our Dad does see
  sin is hid
  taken away
  it is rid
  &nbsp; eternally

  beautiful&apos;s the picture
  we strain to see
  is it true
  could it be
  us restored
  &nbsp; completely
