      look at the picture
      whom do you see
      is it you
      is it me
      a slice of
      &nbsp; humanity

  - lines: |
      look at the picture
      whom do you see
      is it you
      is it He
      a slice of
      &nbsp; divinity

  - lines: |
      odd is the picture
      laid out here now
      it is mixed
      far too mixed
      not as it
      &nbsp; it should be

  - lines: |
      that day of despair
      we wanted to see
      truth was lost
      truth was won
      won back at
      &nbsp; Calvery

  - lines: |
      look at the picture
      sprinkled with Blood
      it was you
      now it&apos;s He
      Dad sees His
      &nbsp; purity

  - lines: |
      beautiful&apos;s the picture
      our Dad does see
      sin is hid
      taken away
      it is rid
      &nbsp; eternally

  - lines: |
      beautiful&apos;s the picture
      we strain to see
      is it true
      could it be
      us restored
      &nbsp; completely
