          Blue pen
          Let's walk
          To loose my thought
          And the others
          Consign them
          Confine them
          Jailor pen
          Can you
          Control them?

    segments:
      - label: "[Verse 1]"
        lines: |
          The chatter hums, a restless din,
          Thoughts collide and pull me in,
          But there you wait, my stern blue guard,
          To lock them up, to stand unmarred.

      - label: "[Chorus]"
        lines: |
          Jailor pen, quell the riot,
          Pin that word (it'll be heard),
          Jailor pen, be my friend,
          Accentuate the quiet.

      - label: "[Verse 2]"
        lines: |
          Blue pen
          Let's walk
          To loose my thought
          And the others
          Consign them
          Confine them
          Jailor pen
          Can you
          Control them?

      - label: "[Bridge]"
        lines: |
          Each stroke a cell, each line a gate,
          You trap the clutter, shift the weight,
          A paradox in ink I see&mdash;
          You cage my mind to set me free.

      - label: "[Chorus]"
        lines: |
          Jailor pen, quell the riot,
          Pin that word (it'll be heard),
          Jailor pen, be my friend,
          Accentuate the quiet.

      - label: "[Verse 3]"
        lines: |
          The wild ones twist, they tug, they fray,
          A storm of threads that won't obey,
          But you, my ward, you bind them still,
          Expel the mess, my soul to fill.

      - label: "[Outro]"
        lines: |
          Blue pen, my shield, my strange release,
          You jail the storm, you grant me peace,
          Thoughts confined, yet I'm unbound,
          In your chains, my wings are found.
