  Every day I breathe a while
  Throw my thoughts on a pile
  Up there on the top
  My dream of Ever Isle

  Every day I run a while
  Chasing an ephemeral smile
  Many-coloured gold-in-pot
  My dream of Ever Isle

  Every day I stop a while
  Resting with easy smile
  I know what I&apos;ve got
  My life in Ever Isle
