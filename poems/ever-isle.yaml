          Every day I breathe a while
          Throw my thoughts on a pile
          Up there on the top
          My dream of Ever Isle
      - lines: |
          Every day I run a while
          Chasing an ephemeral smile
          Many-coloured gold-in-pot
          My dream of Ever Isle
      - lines: |
          Every day I stop a while
          Resting with easy smile
          I know what I've got
          My life in Ever Isle
