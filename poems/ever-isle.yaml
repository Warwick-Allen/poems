segments:
  - lines:
      Every day I breathe a while
      Throw my thoughts on a pile
      Up there on the top
      My dream of Ever Isle

  - lines:
      Every day I run a while
      Chasing an ephemeral smile
      Many-coloured gold-in-pot
      My dream of Ever Isle

  - lines:
      Every day I stop a while
      Resting with easy smile
      I know what I've got
      My life in Ever Isle
