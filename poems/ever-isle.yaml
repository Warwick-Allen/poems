  Every day I breathe a while<br />
  Throw my thoughts on a pile<br />
  Up there on the top<br />
  My dream of Ever Isle<br />
  <br />
  Every day I run a while<br />
  Chasing an ephemeral smile<br />
  Many-coloured gold-in-pot<br />
  My dream of Ever Isle<br />
  <br />
  Every day I stop a while<br />
  Resting with easy smile<br />
  I know what I&apos;ve got<br />
  My life in Ever Isle<br />
