- lines: |
    You&apos;ve no qualm
    Recite your psalm
    On the corner
    Don&apos;t ignore her
    She&apos;s hurting
    You look

- lines: |
    Words cavernous
    Now disastrous
    She will hear
    You don&apos;t care
    She&apos;s hurting
    You ask

- lines: |
    Pontificate
    Form of hate
    You say grace
    See her face
    She&apos;s hurting
    You know

- lines: |
    <em>&hellip; breathe &hellip;</em>

- lines: |
    Words substantial
    Being filled
    In the doing
    Lives combining
    She&apos;s waiting
    For you
