        You've no qualm
        Recite your psalm
        On the corner
        Don't ignore her
        She's hurting
        You look

    - lines: |
        Words cavernous
        Now disastrous
        She will hear
        You don't care
        She's hurting
        You ask

    - lines: |
        Pontificate
        Form of hate
        You say grace
        See her face
        She's hurting
        You know

    - lines: |
        <em>&hellip; breathe &hellip;</em>

    - lines: |
        Words substantial
        Being filled
        In the doing
        Lives combining
        She's waiting
        For you
