Unreal Riddle

{{ Original poem (1997) }}

I see writing on the wall
I want to taste the blood
But I know it's not real
Just my mind playing cruel games
But these games themselves
Cause the blood to be real
I think, I don't know

The blood is not there
I painted the picture myself
With words I don't understand
On a wall that doesn't exist
And blood is on the wall
I think, I don't know

My very thoughts give the wall substance
And make the blood rich, warm, red: real
But the words are still a riddle
A riddle is a riddle
Even if formed in my own mind
Surely I can decipher it
I think, I don't know

The wall keeps me safe
Even if the writing scares me
The wall shelters me
From the cold wind of reality
I guess I want the wall
I built it
I think, I don't know

Maybe I didn't write the words
Or build the wall
But I must have
For the words confuse, the wall imprisons
Nobody else would harm me
Everything is imagined
I think, I think&hellip;

{{ Song arrangement (2025) }}

{Verse 1}
I see writing on the wall;
In blood, fateful words are spelled.
But I know it's not real;
Just my mind plays games so cruel.
But these games, the games themselves,
Cause the blood to be real.

{Pre-chorus}
I think, I don't know

{Chorus}
Inked with blood that's not real,
I am the guilty artist.
And still, blood is on the wall,
A wall that does not exist.

{Verse 2}
It's my mental graffiti;
The words, surely, they are mine,
But their meaning I can't grasp.
It's my self-captivity;
This picture is my confine,
Heavy words that hold me fast.

{Pre-chorus}
I think, I don't know

{Chorus}
Inked with blood that's not real,
I am the guilty artist.
And still, blood is on the wall,
A wall that does not exist.

{Verse 3}
My thoughts give the wall substance,
And make the blood rich, warm, red.
The bleak words are a riddle,
A personal labyrinth,
Even if formed in my head.
I can know it a little.

{Pre-chorus}
I think, I don't know

{Chorus}
Inked with blood that's not real,
I am the guilty artist.
And still, blood is on the wall,
A wall that does not exist.

{Verse 4}
And the wall forms my safehold,
But still the writing scares me.
Was this really my choice here?
The wall shelters me from cold
Harsh wind of reality.
I built the wall, my cloister.

{Pre-chorus}
I think, I don't know

{Chorus}
Inked with blood that's not real,
I am the guilty artist.
And still, blood is on the wall,
A wall that does not exist.

{Verse 5}
Could it really be me who's
Written those dread words that haunt
On the wall that imprisons?
The wall restrains, words confuse;
Only I'd capture and taunt.
Everything is imagined.

{Pre-chorus}
I think, I don't know

{Chorus}
Inked with blood that's not real,
I am the guilty artist.
And still, blood is on the wall,
A wall that does not exist.

{Outro}
I don't know, I don't know, oh
I think, I think
I think, I think
I think&hellip;

<h3>Introduction</h3>
&quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; presents an exploration of psychological
  confinement and the paradoxical nature of self-constructed mental prisons.
  The song operates as a metaphysical meditation on the relationship between
  perception, reality, and personal agency, employing the central metaphor
  of blood-written words upon an imaginary wall to examine themes of guilt,
  isolation, and epistemic uncertainty.
<h3>Central Metaphor and Symbolism</h3>
The dominant metaphor of the wall inscribed with blood serves multiple
  symbolic functions throughout the piece. The wall represents psychological
  barriers---both protective and imprisoning---that the speaker has
  constructed within their own mind. The blood, repeatedly emphasised as
  &quot;not real&quot; yet paradoxically present, embodies the complex
  relationship between imagined and experienced trauma. This duality
  reflects the genuine psychological impact of mental constructs, even when
  recognised as illusory.
The phrase &quot;writing on the wall&quot; invokes biblical connotations
  of divine judgment and prophecy, yet here it becomes deeply personal and
  self-authored. The speaker's identification as the &quot;guilty
  artist&quot; transforms them from passive recipient of judgment to active
  creator of their own psychological torment, raising questions about
  culpability and self-determination.
<h3>Structure and Repetition</h3>
The song's structure reinforces its thematic content through cyclical
  repetition. The recurring pre-chorus &quot;I think, I don't know&quot;
  encapsulates the speaker's epistemic crisis---the fundamental
  uncertainty about their own mental processes and agency. This phrase
  becomes increasingly significant as it appears throughout, suggesting a
  mind caught between rational analysis and emotional confusion.
The repetitive nature of the chorus creates a sense of being trapped
  within a loop, mirroring the psychological imprisonment described in the
  lyrics. The escalating repetition in the outro (&quot;I think, I
  think&hellip;&quot;) suggests either mounting anxiety or the mechanical
  nature of obsessive thought patterns.
<h3>Progression of Self-Understanding</h3>
The five verses trace a journey of gradual, though incomplete,
  self-awareness. The progression moves from initial confusion (&quot;their
  meaning I can't grasp&quot;) through growing recognition of personal
  responsibility (&quot;I built the wall, my cloister&quot;) to final
  questioning of agency (&quot;Could it really be me who's written those
  dread words?&quot;).
This arc reflects the complex process of psychological insight, where
  understanding one's role in creating mental suffering doesn't
  necessarily lead to liberation from it. The speaker's growing
  awareness paradoxically increases their uncertainty, suggesting that
  self-knowledge can be as imprisoning as ignorance.
<h3>Language and Tone</h3>
The vocabulary choices create a gothic, almost medieval atmosphere through
  words like &quot;cloister,&quot; &quot;confine,&quot; and
  &quot;captivity.&quot; This linguistic register elevates the speaker's
  internal struggle to the level of epic or religious drama, whilst
  simultaneously suggesting monastic isolation and penitential suffering.
The juxtaposition of concrete imagery (&quot;blood,&quot;
  &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;words&quot;) with assertions of unreality creates
  cognitive dissonance that mirrors the speaker's psychological state.
  This tension between the tangible and intangible reflects broader
  philosophical questions about the nature of mental experience.
<h3>Themes of Agency and Responsibility</h3>
Central to the song is the paradox of self-authored suffering. The speaker
  simultaneously claims authorship (&quot;I am the guilty artist&quot;) and
  questions their agency (&quot;Was this really my choice here?&quot;). This
  reflects the complex relationship between conscious will and psychological
  compulsion, particularly relevant to understanding depression, anxiety,
  and other mental health conditions where individuals may feel responsible
  for thoughts and feelings beyond their direct control.
The wall's dual nature---as both &quot;safehold&quot; and
  prison---illustrates how psychological defences can become
  self-defeating. The protection from the &quot;harsh wind of reality&quot;
  comes at the cost of genuine freedom, suggesting the difficult balance
  between necessary psychological boundaries and self-imposed limitations.
<h3>Philosophical Implications</h3>
The song engages with fundamental questions about the nature of reality
  and mental experience. The assertion that imagined constructs can have
  real effects (&quot;My thoughts give the wall substance&quot;) touches on
  phenomenological philosophy and the reality of subjective experience. The
  speaker's situation exemplifies how mental constructs, even when
  recognised as constructs, retain their power to affect behaviour and
  emotion.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
&quot;Unreal Riddle&quot; succeeds as both a psychological portrait and
  philosophical meditation. Its strength lies in its refusal to offer simple
  resolutions to complex mental states. The speaker's journey towards
  self-understanding doesn't culminate in liberation but in deeper
  recognition of their paradoxical situation. The song's power derives
  from its honest depiction of how self-awareness can coexist with continued
  psychological entrapment, making it a particularly nuanced exploration of
  mental imprisonment and the elusive nature of personal freedom.
The work ultimately suggests that understanding the mechanisms of our
  psychological prisons may be a necessary first step towards freedom, even
  if that understanding doesn't immediately provide the key to escape.
  In this way, the &quot;riddle&quot; of the title remains appropriately
  unsolved, reflecting the ongoing nature of psychological struggle and
  self-discovery.
