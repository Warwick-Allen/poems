        lines: |
          Oh Lord, You laid the earth in motion,
          Spoke the stars to light the sky.
          The wind sings endless admiration,
          And the mountains testify.
          I walked in dust, my heart was broken,
          Lost my all beneath Your gaze,
          Yet still Your voice, it softly spoken,
          Guided me through the shadowed days.
      - label: Chorus
        lines: |
          Great are You, God, in the storm and the flame,
          Goodness flows from Your unequaled name.
          I lift my eyes from the tear-stained sod,
          And sing of the greatness of my God.
      - label: Verse 2
        lines: |
          You let the tempest tear my shelter,
          Stripped my hands of fleeting gold,
          But in the silence, I felt Your splendor,
          A wealth that cannot be stole'.
          Your knowledge boundless, wisdom greater,
          Beyond what mortal minds can know.
          In every trial, I stand and wonder,
          At the mercy You still show.

          I lift my eyes from the tear-stained sod,
          And sing of the greatness of my God.

        lines: |
          Who am I to question Your purpose?
          I'm dust beneath Your boundless flame,
          You hold the dawn, the dusk, the cosmos,
          And call me gently by my name.
          From ashes, Lord, You lift my soul,
          Your love remains, it makes me whole.

        lines: |
          So here I stand, though scarred and humbled,
          Before Your throne, my spirit free,
          The world may shake, the proud may stumble,
          But Your grace is all I see.
          Oh Lord of all, of dust and glory,
          Forever Yours, my song will be.
