  <br />On behalf of the voiceless:<br />
  <br />
  please<br />
  <br />On behalf of the heartless:<br />
  <br />
  yeah, but<br />
  &nbsp; we provide quality<br />
  &nbsp; not quantity<br />
  yeah, but<br />
  &nbsp; all of these<br />
  &nbsp; just too many<br />
  yeah, but<br />
  &nbsp; 750 already<br />
  &nbsp; our good deed<br />
  yeah, but<br />
  &nbsp; mouths to feed<br />
  &nbsp; we have plenty<br />
  yeah, but<br />
  &nbsp; we are tiny<br />
  &nbsp; can't you see<br />
  <br />
  anyway (this is plain to see)<br />
  there's no way (that we can help)<br />
  because (this is plain to see)<br />
  we have lost<br />
  our way
