          yeah, but
          &nbsp; we provide quality
          &nbsp; not quantity
          yeah, but
          &nbsp; all of these
          &nbsp; just too many
          yeah, but
          &nbsp; 750 already
          &nbsp; our good deed
          yeah, but
          &nbsp; mouths to feed
          &nbsp; we have plenty

          we have lost
          our way
