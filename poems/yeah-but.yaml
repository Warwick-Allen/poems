  <br />On behalf of the voiceless:

  please
  <br />On behalf of the heartless:

  yeah, but
  &nbsp; we provide quality
  &nbsp; not quantity
  yeah, but
  &nbsp; all of these
  &nbsp; just too many
  yeah, but
  &nbsp; 750 already
  &nbsp; our good deed
  yeah, but
  &nbsp; mouths to feed
  &nbsp; we have plenty
  yeah, but
  &nbsp; we are tiny
  &nbsp; can't you see

  anyway (this is plain to see)
  there's no way (that we can help)
  because (this is plain to see)
  we have lost
  our way
