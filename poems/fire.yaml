          There is a spark in the cold night
          I ignore it
          It is harmless

      - lines: |
          Again, there is a spark in the cold night
          Again, I ignore it
          It is harmless

      - lines: |
          And all across the landscape
          So rich, abundant, full of life
          Yet strangely empty

      - lines: |
          Sparks occur and sparks go out
          For the most part
          They are harmless

      - lines: |
          But occasionally a spark will catch alight
          And a flame will arise and feed on
          The living landscape

      - lines: |
          This flame offers some hope
          Of warmth in the coldness
          I am drawn to it

      - lines: |
          The flame, however, is feeble and unfaithful
          To its promise of comfort
          It is only a tease

      - lines: |
          And the life it feeds on is precious to me
          It causes me pain
          As it burns

      - lines: |
          This flame, furthermore, has arisen
          In a dangerous place, a place where
          Fire must not be

      - lines: |
          For an unstoppable inferno it could become
          And those things that are precious to me
          It would destroy

      - lines: |
          I must kill the flame, but I can't
          It has me hypnotised with its colours dancing before me
          Just out of reach

      - lines: |
          And its promise of warmth
          Although so unreliable
          Keeps me hoping

      - lines: |
          I know, somewhere deep within my consciousness
          That this flame will wither and die as have
          Hundreds before

      - lines: |
          I long to break free from the spell
          But
          Its hold is too strong
