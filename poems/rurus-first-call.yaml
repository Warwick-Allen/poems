          Ruru wakens
          Heart hastens
          Is it really
          No, can't be
          That time again?
          Again

      - lines: |
          Day's been
          Done somethin'
          Much not done
          Racing the sun
          The sun won
          Again

      - lines: |
          Race fail
          But my battle
          &mdash;Important one
          It is won
          When I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
          When I ask
          &ldquo;Did I love?&rdquo;
