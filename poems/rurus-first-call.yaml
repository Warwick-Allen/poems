  Ruru wakens
  Heart hastens
  Is it really
  No, can&apos;t be
  That time again?
  Again

  Day&apos;s been
  Done somethin&apos;
  Much not done
  Racing the sun
  The sun won
  Again

  Race fail
  But my battle
  &mdash;Important one
  It is won
  When I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
  When I ask
  &ldquo;Did I love?&rdquo;
