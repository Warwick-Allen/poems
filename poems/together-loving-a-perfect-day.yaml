          Before light
          Rooster's asleep
          As close to silence as this home knows
          I walk a well-trodden path
          To a sacred rendezvous
          That hidden place

      - lines: |
          My ears are open
          My tongue is loosed
          And I commune
          Deeply
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautifully

      - lines: |
          With my Soul Lover
          My Big Brother
          My Redeemer
          The Reliever
          Of my care, all my fear
          My Dearest Dad
          My Provider
          My Path Finder
          And I hear, I always hear

          The rooster crows
          The sun breaks through
          Unveiling the glory of the new
          New day, new move
          God is here

      - lines: |
          I join with giants of the faith
          Together we invite
          Jesus to build His church
          We exalt
          We petition
          We hear
          We know
          The Kingdom of God has come
          And is coming
          To this place

          Breakfast is a group affair
          My wife, children and our new family
          Sisters, aunties, brothers, uncles
          And our children in the Lord

      - lines: |
          Talk is vibrant, buzzing
          Miracles of yesterday
          Expectations for today
          Of studies and sabbaticals
          Of triumphs in the battles

          Praying, eating
          Teaching, living
          Together loving

          A day of experiencing
          God leading, revealing
          Equipping and healing

      - lines: |
          A day in which the Spirit of the Lord works through us
          As He proclaims good news to the poor
          Freedom for prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind
          As He sets the oppressed free
          And outworks the day of the Lord's favour

          With evening comes celebration
          Of life and togetherness
          We have a feast
          And all are welcome
          Merriment and thanksgiving
          Eating, laughing
          Together loving

      - lines: |
          Dinner ate, dishes done
          The instruments come
          The singing starts
          The King is exalted
          By joyous and thankful hearts

      - lines: |
          A time for teaching follows
          For sharing lessons learned
          And a time for interceding
          Laying before the Lord each other's burden

          At the conclusion
          Of a day that saw
          Mountains thrown into the sea
          Sleep comes quickly
          It's restful and peaceful
          And always sufficient
          Such that I'm fully equipped
          To meet the challenges
          And to do the work
          Of the coming day
