  Before light<br />
  Rooster&apos;s asleep<br />
  As close to silence as this home knows<br />
  I walk a well-trodden path<br />
  To a sacred rendezvous<br />
  That hidden place<br />
  <br />
  My ears are open<br />
  My tongue is loosed<br />
  And I commune<br />
  Deeply<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautifully<br />
  <br />
  With my Soul Lover<br />
  My Big Brother<br />
  My Redeemer<br />
  The Reliever<br />
  Of my care, all my fear<br />
  My Dearest Dad<br />
  My Provider<br />
  My Path Finder<br />
  And I hear, I always hear<br />
  <br />
  &mdash;<br />
  <br />
  The rooster crows<br />
  The sun breaks through<br />
  Unveiling the glory of the new<br />
  New day, new move<br />
  God is here<br />
  <br />
  I join with giants of the faith<br />
  Together we invite<br />
  Jesus to build His church<br />
  We exalt<br />
  We petition<br />
  We hear<br />
  We know<br />
  The Kingdom of God has come<br />
  And is coming<br />
  To this place<br />
  <br />
  &mdash;<br />
  <br />
  Breakfast is a group affair<br />
  My wife, children and our new family<br />
  Sisters, aunties, brothers, uncles<br />
  And our children in the Lord<br />
  <br />
  Talk is vibrant, buzzing<br />
  Miracles of yesterday<br />
  Expectations for today<br />
  Of studies and sabbaticals<br />
  Of triumphs in the battles<br />
  <br />
  &mdash;<br />
  <br />
  A day of walking, meeting<br />
  Praying, eating<br />
  Teaching, living<br />
  Together loving<br />
  <br />
  A day of experiencing<br />
  God leading, revealing<br />
  Equipping and healing<br />
  <br />
  A day in which the Spirit of the Lord works through us<br />
  As He proclaims good news to the poor<br />
  Freedom for prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind<br />
  As He sets the oppressed free<br />
  And outworks the day of the Lord&apos;s favour<br />
  <br />
  &mdash;<br />
  <br />
  With evening comes celebration<br />
  Of life and togetherness<br />
  We have a feast<br />
  And all are welcome<br />
  Merriment and thanksgiving<br />
  Eating, laughing<br />
  Together loving<br />
  <br />
  Dinner ate, dishes done<br />
  The instruments come<br />
  The singing starts<br />
  The King is exalted<br />
  By joyous and thankful hearts<br />
  <br />
  A time for teaching follows<br />
  For sharing lessons learned<br />
  And a time for interceding<br />
  Laying before the Lord each other&apos;s burden<br />
  <br />
  &mdash;<br />
  <br />
  At the conclusion<br />
  Of a day that saw<br />
  Mountains thrown into the sea<br />
  Sleep comes quickly<br />
  It&apos;s restful and peaceful<br />
  And always sufficient<br />
  Such that I&apos;m fully equipped<br />
  To meet the challenges<br />
  And to do the work<br />
  Of the coming day<br />
