  Before light
  Rooster&apos;s asleep
  As close to silence as this home knows
  I walk a well-trodden path
  To a sacred rendezvous
  That hidden place

  My ears are open
  My tongue is loosed
  And I commune
  Deeply
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautifully

  With my Soul Lover
  My Big Brother
  My Redeemer
  The Reliever
  Of my care, all my fear
  My Dearest Dad
  My Provider
  My Path Finder
  And I hear, I always hear

  &mdash;

  The rooster crows
  The sun breaks through
  Unveiling the glory of the new
  New day, new move
  God is here

  I join with giants of the faith
  Together we invite
  Jesus to build His church
  We exalt
  We petition
  We hear
  We know
  The Kingdom of God has come
  And is coming
  To this place

  &mdash;

  Breakfast is a group affair
  My wife, children and our new family
  Sisters, aunties, brothers, uncles
  And our children in the Lord

  Talk is vibrant, buzzing
  Miracles of yesterday
  Expectations for today
  Of studies and sabbaticals
  Of triumphs in the battles

  &mdash;

  A day of walking, meeting
  Praying, eating
  Teaching, living
  Together loving

  A day of experiencing
  God leading, revealing
  Equipping and healing

  A day in which the Spirit of the Lord works through us
  As He proclaims good news to the poor
  Freedom for prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind
  As He sets the oppressed free
  And outworks the day of the Lord&apos;s favour

  &mdash;

  With evening comes celebration
  Of life and togetherness
  We have a feast
  And all are welcome
  Merriment and thanksgiving
  Eating, laughing
  Together loving

  Dinner ate, dishes done
  The instruments come
  The singing starts
  The King is exalted
  By joyous and thankful hearts

  A time for teaching follows
  For sharing lessons learned
  And a time for interceding
  Laying before the Lord each other&apos;s burden

  &mdash;

  At the conclusion
  Of a day that saw
  Mountains thrown into the sea
  Sleep comes quickly
  It&apos;s restful and peaceful
  And always sufficient
  Such that I&apos;m fully equipped
  To meet the challenges
  And to do the work
  Of the coming day
