  Eggshells narrowly escape<br />
  feet awkwardly crash between<br />
  And the load shouldered<br />
  precious, fragile, teetering<br />
  <br />
  New terrain, strangely familiar<br />
  strange turns<br />
  through pit holes and trenches<br />
  gradually climbing<br />
  <br />
  A torch for the feet<br />
  a necessary comfort<br />
  The direction unknown<br />
  just press on up<br />
  <br />
  The terrain is rugged<br />
  But the load shouldered<br />
  precious, fragile, balanced<br />
  Is not shouldered alone<br />
