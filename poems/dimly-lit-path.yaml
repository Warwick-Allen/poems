        Eggshells narrowly escape
        feet awkwardly crash between
        And the load shouldered
        precious, fragile, teetering

    - lines: |
        New terrain, strangely familiar
        strange turns
        through pit holes and trenches
        gradually climbing

    - lines: |
        A torch for the feet
        a necessary comfort
        The direction unknown
        just press on up

    - lines: |
        The terrain is rugged
        But the load shouldered
        precious, fragile, balanced
        Is not shouldered alone
