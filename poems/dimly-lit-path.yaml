segments:
- lines: |
    Eggshells narrowly escape
    feet awkwardly crash between
    And the load shouldered
    precious, fragile, teetering

- lines: |
    New terrain, strangely familiar
    strange turns
    through pit holes and trenches
    gradually climbing

- lines: |
    A torch for the feet
    a necessary comfort
    The direction unknown
    just press on up

- lines: |
    The terrain is rugged
    But the load shouldered
    precious, fragile, balanced
    Is not shouldered alone
