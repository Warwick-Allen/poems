      What strange tricks the light can play
      Oh, how one can be fooled by illusions
      Created at certain angles

  - lines: |
      From where I stand, it surely seems
      That you're atop a tower
      A magnificent, strong and mighty tower

  - lines: |
      This tower you've built yourself
      With bricks of hard work
      Bound with mortar of love

  - lines: |
      You're still building
      Steadily climbing higher
      Destined to reach giddy heights

  - lines: |
      Why then does it look to you
      That you're in a well
      That you have to rise to reach the ground

  - lines: |
      Please come and stand beside me
      In the light, where you can see
      Don't be fooled by the shadows any longer

  - lines: |
      But please take care
      With the foundations on which you build
      Lest your tower come crashing down

  - lines: |
      Make your foundations of rock
      Nothing else will be strong enough
      Build on the Rock and reach heavenward
