      What strange tricks the light can play<br />
      Oh, how one can be fooled by illusions<br />
      Created at certain angles<br />
      <br />
      From where I stand, it surely seems<br />
      That you&#39;re atop a tower<br />
      A magnificent, strong and mighty tower<br />
      <br />
      This tower you&#39;ve built yourself<br />
      With bricks of hard work<br />
      Bound with mortar of love<br />
      <br />
      You&#39;re still building<br />
      Steadily climbing higher<br />
      Destined to reach giddy heights<br />
      <br />
      Why then does it look to you<br />
      That you&#39;re in a well<br />
      That you have to rise to reach the ground<br />
      <br />
      Please come and stand beside me<br />
      In the light, where you can see<br />
      Don&#39;t be fooled by the shadows any longer<br />
      <br />
      But please take care<br />
      With the foundations on which you build<br />
      Lest your tower come crashing down<br />
      <br />
      Make your foundations of rock<br />
      Nothing else will be strong enough<br />
      Build on the Rock and reach heavenward<br />
