Precious
2015-08-02

A lie torturous
Sold
By men contemptuous
Told
To lives precious
Cold
Hearts treat worthless
Gold
Their sole worship
Hell
Their course plotted
How
To touch minds knotted
Tell
Men, men corrupted
Yell
The truth unhindered
Smell
Life sweetly savoured
Now
Through our Saviour
Old
Courses Altered
Cold
Hearts are melted
Evil
Men made righteous
All
Souls are precious
