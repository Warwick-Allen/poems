    segments:
      - lines: |
          I feel my soul
          Is in need of nourishment
          But deep within me
          I hear the whisper
          The gentle whisper
          Of the Spirit of God

      - lines: |
          A thick cloud has enveloped me
          Cold mist has surrounded me
          Only some
          Of the joyful banter of friends
          Of their light
          Filters through
          And it's muffled
          Dampened by the darkness
          And through that darkness
          They only
          See part of me

      - lines: |
          But the whisper remains
          Continuing to encourage

      - lines: |
          My heart is heavy
          Anxiety, fear of failure
          Letting others down
          Weigh on my mind
          And my body
          Is reluctant to move

      - lines: |
          But still I hear the whisper
          That blessed whisper
          And I know
          All is well with my soul
