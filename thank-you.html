<div class="poem-body">
When I was down<br />
I asked for your hand<br />
You cradled me in your arms<br />
<br />
When I was falling<br />
I asked for you to catch me<br />
You lifted me oh so high<br />
<br />
When I was in darkness<br />
I asked for some light<br />
You flooded my life with your brilliance<br />
<br />
When I was lost<br />
I asked for directions<br />
You guided me by your hand<br />
<br />
Now I am yours, Lord<br />
I was from the beginning<br />
At least now I know<br />
<br />
Never let me go, Lord<br />
I can&apos;t live without your love<br />
The darkness scares me so<br />
