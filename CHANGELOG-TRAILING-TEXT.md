# Changelog: Trailing Text Ignored for Line-Anchored Tokens

**Date**: 2025-10-08

## Summary

Implemented a new requirement for the Poem file format: any text after a line-anchored token on the same line is now officially ignored by the parser. This allows for inline comments and notes throughout poem files.

## Rationale

This change:
1. Extends an existing pattern (already used for comment blocks and multi-line variables) to all line-anchored tokens
2. Provides consistency across the specification
3. Enables inline documentation and comments for improved readability
4. Does not contradict any existing requirements

## Changes

### 1. EBNF Grammar (`poem-syntax.ebnf`)

Updated the grammar to consume trailing text for:
- Dividers (`----`)
- End markers (`====`)
- Version labels ({% raw %}`{{ ... }}`{% endraw %})
- Segment labels (`{ ... }`)
- Postscript labels
- Analysis labels (`{Synopsis}`, `{Full}`)
- Literal block markers (`<<<`, `>>>`)
- Comment block markers (`<<#`, `#>>`) - *already specified*
- Multi-line variable markers (`={...}<<=`, `=>>`) - *already specified*

**Exception**: Single-line variable definitions (`={name}=value`) are excluded as everything after `}=` is the variable value.

Added semantic constraint #4 documenting this behaviour.

### 2. Human-Readable Documentation (`POEM-SYNTAX.md`)

Added comprehensive documentation:
- New "Trailing Text Rule" section under "Line Anchoring"
- Updated rules for Versions, Audio, Postscript, and Analysis sections
- Updated examples showing inline comments (e.g., `----  # comment`)
- Clarified behaviour for comment blocks, literal blocks, and multi-line variables

### 3. Example File (`poems/_example.poem`)

Enhanced with inline comments demonstrating the feature:
{% raw %}
```
{{ Version 1 }}  # Original poem structure
{Stanza 1}  # Opening stanza
----  # Divider between versions
====  # End of versions
<<<  # Start of literal block
>>>  # End of literal block
```
{% endraw %}

Added new "Dividers and Inline Comments" section explaining the feature.

### 4. Vim Syntax Highlighting (`vim/syntax/poem.vim`)

Updated syntax rules to:
- Highlight trailing text as comments
- Support optional trailing text for all line-anchored tokens
- Added `poemTrailingText` syntax group linked to Comment highlight

### 5. Documentation Files

Updated:
- `VIM-SYNTAX.md` - Added trailing text feature to features list
- `QUICKSTART-VIM.md` - Added trailing text to highlight table

## Examples

### Before (implicit behaviour):
{% raw %}
```
----
====
{{ Version 1 }}
{Stanza 1}
```
{% endraw %}

### After (explicit specification with inline comments):
{% raw %}
```
----  # End of first version
====  # End of poem section
{{ Version 1 }}  # Original version
{Stanza 1}  # Opening stanza
```
{% endraw %}

Both forms are valid, but the specification now explicitly states that trailing text is ignored.

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible**

Existing poem files without trailing text continue to work exactly as before. The change only formalises what parsers should do with trailing text and enables a new optional feature (inline comments).

## Files Modified

1. `poem-syntax.ebnf` - Grammar rules and semantic constraints
2. `POEM-SYNTAX.md` - Human-readable documentation
3. `poems/_example.poem` - Example file with demonstrations
4. `vim/syntax/poem.vim` - Vim syntax highlighting
5. `VIM-SYNTAX.md` - Vim syntax documentation
6. `QUICKSTART-VIM.md` - Quick start guide
7. `CHANGELOG-TRAILING-TEXT.md` - This changelog (new)

## Implementation Notes

Parser implementations should:
1. Consume all characters after line-anchored tokens up to the newline
2. Discard this trailing text (do not include in output)
3. Exception: For single-line variables (`={name}=value`), the value consumes everything after `}=`
4. Consider emitting the ignored text in debug/verbose mode for transparency

## Testing Recommendations

Test cases should verify:
1. Trailing text is properly ignored for all line-anchored tokens
2. Inline comments with various characters work correctly
3. Empty trailing text (just whitespace) is handled
4. Single-line variables still capture their values correctly
5. Existing files without trailing text continue to parse correctly
