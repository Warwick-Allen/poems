[Intro]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory,
for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!

[Verse 2]
Why should the nations say,
“Where is their God?”

[Verse 3]
Our God is in the heavens;
he does all that he pleases.

[Verse 4]
Their idols are silver and gold,
the work of human hands.

[Verse 5]
They have mouths, but do not speak;
eyes, but do not see.

[Verse 6]
They have ears, but do not hear;
noses, but do not smell.

[Verse 7]
They have hands, but do not feel;
feet, but do not walk;
and they do not make a sound in their throat.

[Verse 8]
Those who make them become like them;
so do all who trust in them.

[Verse 9]
O Israel, trust in the Lord!
He is their help and their shield.

[Verse 10]
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord!
He is their help and their shield.

[Verse 11]
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord!
He is their help and their shield.

[Verse 12]
The Lord has remembered us; he will bless us;
he will bless the house of Israel;
he will bless the house of Aaron;

[Verse 13]
he will bless those who fear the Lord,
both the small and the great.

[Verse 14]
May the Lord give you increase,
you and your children!

[Verse 15]
May you be blessed by the Lord,
who made heaven and earth!

[Verse 16]
The heavens are the Lord's heavens,
but the earth he has given to the children of man.

[Verse 17]
The dead do not praise the Lord,
nor do any who go down into silence.

[Verse 18]
But we will bless the Lord
from this time forth and for evermore.

[Outro]
Praise the Lord!
