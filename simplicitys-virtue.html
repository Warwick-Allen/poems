<div class="poem-body">
never thought I could<br />
never thought I would<br />
&apos;o no no no n&apos; no no no<br />
it&apos;s not what you said<br />
just some old bones<br />
rattling in my head<br />
<br />
so I journey<br />
never through the heart<br />
can&apos;t you see<br />
that is where<br />
the trouble starts<br />
<br />
got out of control<br />
got to take a hold<br />
&apos;o so so so s&apos; so so so<br />
just ashes and dust<br />
trying on my own<br />t
hought that I must<br />
<br />
so I wander<br />
never through the heart<br />
stop and ponder<br />
that is where<br />
the trouble starts<br />
<br />
got to reach you<br />
got to run from you<br />
got to reach you<br />
tearing me in two<br />
<br />
simplicity&apos;s virtue<br />
such I teach you<br />
&apos;ou you you you y&apos; you you you<br />
it&apos;s all I got<br />
but it&apos;s a lot<br />
<br />
so I travel (got to reach you)<br />
never through the heart (got to run from you)<br />
can&apos;t you tell<br />
that is where<br />
the trouble starts (tearing me in two)<br />
