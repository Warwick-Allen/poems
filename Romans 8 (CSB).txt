# Romans 8 (CSB)

(mellow, blues, funk, male vocals, New Zealand accent)

[Verse 1]
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus,

[Verse 2]
because the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.

[Verse 3]
For what the law could not do since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering,

[Verse 4]
in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

[Verse 5]
For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit.

[Verse 6]
Now the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace.

[Verse 7]
The mindset of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit to God’s law. Indeed, it is unable to do so.

[Verse 8]
Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

[Verse 9]
You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.

[Verse 10]
Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.

[Verse 11]
And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then he who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through his Spirit who lives in you.

[Verse 12]
So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh,

[Verse 13]
because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

[Verse 14]
For all those led by God’s Spirit are God’s sons.

[Verse 15]
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”

[Verse 16]
The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God’s children,

[Verse 17]
and if children, also heirs — heirs of God and coheirs with Christ — if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

[Verse 18]
For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.

[Verse 19]
For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed.

[Verse 20]
For the creation was subjected to futility — not willingly, but because of him who subjected it — in the hope

[Verse 21]
that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage to decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children.

[Verse 22]
For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labour pains until now.

[Verse 23]
Not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits — we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.

[Verse 24]
Now in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?

[Verse 25]
Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.

[Verse 26]
In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.

[Verse 27]
And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

[Verse 28]
We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.

[Verse 29]
For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.

[Verse 30]
And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.

[Verse 31]
What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?

[Verse 32]
He did not even spare his own Son but gave him up for us all. How will he not also with him grant us everything?

[Verse 33]
Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies.

[Verse 34]
Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.

[Verse 35]
Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

[Verse 36]
As it is written:

    Because of you

    we are being put to death all day long;

    we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.


[Verse 37]
No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

[Verse 38]
For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,

[Verse 39]
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
