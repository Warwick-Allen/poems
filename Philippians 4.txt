And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

[Verse]

What you have learned and received and heard and seen: practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
