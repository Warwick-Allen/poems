<em>[Intro]</em><br />
(There&apos;s no condemnation.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 1]</em><br />
Therefore, there is now no<br />
condemnation for those<br />
in Christ Jesus, because<br />
the law of the Spirit<br />
of life in Christ Jesus<br />
has set you free from the<br />
law of sin and of death.<br />
<br />
(We&apos;re free from sin and death.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 2]</em><br />
For what the law could not<br />
do since it was weakened<br />
by the flesh, God did. He<br />
condemned sin in the flesh<br />
by sending his own Son<br />
in the likeness of sin;<br />
like sinful flesh He came.<br />
<br />
(Christ came to condemn sin.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 3]</em><br />
As a sin offering<br />
He came, so that the law&apos;s<br />
requirement would be<br />
fulfilled in us who do<br />
not walk according to<br />
the flesh but according<br />
to the Spirit (we walk).<br />
<br />
(We walk by the Spirit.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 4]</em><br />
For those who live by the<br />
flesh (in the flesh), they have<br />
their minds set on the things<br />
of the flesh, but those who<br />
live according to the<br />
Spirit have their minds set<br />
on things of the Spirit.<br />
<br />
(Our minds are set on Christ.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 5]</em><br />
Now the mindset of the<br />
flesh, it is death, but the<br />
mindset of the Spirit<br />
is life and peace. The mind<br />
set on the flesh is hos-<br />
tile to God because<br />
(no) it does not submit.<br />
<br />
(The Spirit brings life and peace.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 6]</em><br />
The fleshly mind does not<br />
submit to God&apos;s law &mdash; it&apos;s<br />
unable. Those who are<br />
in the flesh cannot please<br />
God. You, however, are<br />
not in the flesh, but in<br />
the Spirit (if you are).<br />
<br />
(We are in the Spirit.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 7]</em><br />
You are in the Spirit,<br />
if God&apos;s Spirit lives in<br />
you. Anyone who does<br />
not have the Spirit of<br />
Christ, he does not belong<br />
to Him. You are in the<br />
Spirit if He&apos;s in you.<br />
<br />
(We belong to Jesus.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 8]</em><br />
Now if Christ is in you,<br />
the body is dead due<br />
to sin, but the Spirit,<br />
because of righteousness,<br />
gives life. If He who raised<br />
Christ lives in you, He will<br />
bring your bodies to life.<br />
<br />
(He will raise our bodies.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 9]</em><br />
If the Spirit of him<br />
who raised Jesus from the<br />
dead lives in you, then he<br />
who raised Christ from the dead<br />
will also bring life to<br />
your mortal bodies through<br />
his Spirit, who&apos;s in you.<br />
<br />
(The Spirit is in us.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 10]</em><br />
So, Brothers and Sisters,<br />
we&apos;re not obligated<br />
to the flesh to live in<br />
accordance with the flesh,<br />
because if you live in<br />
the flesh, you are going<br />
to die (you&apos;ll surely die).<br />
<br />
(We don&apos;t live by the flesh.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 11]</em><br />
But if by the Spirit<br />
you put to death the deeds<br />
of the body, you will<br />
live. For all led by God&apos;s<br />
Spirit are God&apos;s sons. For<br />
you did not receive a<br />
spirit of slavery.<br />
<br />
(We are children of God.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 12]</em><br />
For you did not receive<br />
a slavery spirit<br />
to fall back into fear.<br />
No, instead, you received<br />
the Spirit of holy<br />
adoption, by whom we<br />
cry out, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
(We cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 13]</em><br />
The Spirit himself does<br />
testify, along with<br />
our spirit that we are<br />
God&apos;s children, and if so,<br />
also heirs &mdash; heirs of God,<br />
and coheirs with Christ &mdash; if<br />
we suffer with Jesus.<br />
<br />
(We are coheirs with Christ.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 14]</em><br />
We are coheirs with Christ<br />
if we suffer, suffer<br />
with Him so that we may<br />
also be glorified<br />
with Him. For I reckon<br />
the current sufferings<br />
are not worth comparing.<br />
<br />
(We will be glorified.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 15]</em><br />
The current sufferings<br />
are not worth comparing<br />
with the glory that is<br />
going to be revealed<br />
to us. For creation<br />
waits in eager, patient<br />
anticipation (hope).<br />
<br />
(Creation is waiting.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 16]</em><br />
With anticipation<br />
And eagerness, nature<br />
waits for God&apos;s sons to be<br />
revealed. Creation<br />
was subjected to be<br />
futile &mdash; not by its<br />
will: He subjected it.<br />
<br />
(Nature was subjected.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 17]</em><br />
Creation was made to<br />
be futile because<br />
of him who subjected<br />
it &mdash; in the hope that the<br />
creation itself will<br />
also be set free from<br />
the bondage to its decay.<br />
<br />
(It&apos;ll be free from decay.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 18]</em><br />
And in the hope that it<br />
will enter into the<br />
glorious freedom of<br />
God&apos;s children. For we know<br />
that the whole creation<br />
has been groaning with pains<br />
of labour until now.<br />
<br />
(Creation is groaning.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 19]</em><br />
Not just that, but we who<br />
have the Spirit as the<br />
first fruits &mdash; we also groan<br />
inside, and eagerly<br />
waiting for adoption,<br />
our bodies&apos; redemption.<br />
<br />
(Waiting for adoption.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 20]</em><br />
Now in this hope we were<br />
saved, but hope that is seen<br />
is not hope, because who<br />
hopes for what he sees? Now<br />
if we hope for what we<br />
don&apos;t see, we wait for it,<br />
eagerly, patiently.<br />
<br />
(We wait with eager hope.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 21]</em><br />
Likewise, the Spirit helps<br />
us in our weakness, as<br />
we don&apos;t know what to pray<br />
for as we should, but the<br />
Spirit intercedes for<br />
us with ineffable<br />
groanings (He groans for us).<br />
<br />
(The Spirit intercedes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 22]</em><br />
And he who searches our<br />
hearts knows the mind of the<br />
Spirit, because He gives<br />
intercession for the<br />
saints according to the<br />
will of God. (The Spirit<br />
intercedes for the saints).<br />
<br />
(Intercedes for the saints.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 23]</em><br />
We know that all things work<br />
together for the good<br />
of those who love God, who<br />
are called according to<br />
His purpose. For those he<br />
foreknew he also did<br />
predestine to conform.<br />
<br />
(All things work together.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 24]</em><br />
He predestined them to<br />
conform to the image<br />
of his Son, so that He<br />
would be the firstborn of<br />
many brothers, sisters.<br />
And those he predestined,<br />
those, He also did call.<br />
<br />
(He called us to conform.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 25]</em><br />
And those He called, also<br />
He justified; and those<br />
He justified, also<br />
He glorified. What, then,<br />
are we to say about<br />
these things? If God is for<br />
us, who is against us?<br />
<br />
(God is for His children.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 26]</em><br />
He did not even spare<br />
His own Son but gave Him<br />
up for us all. How will<br />
He not also with Him<br />
grant us everything?<br />
(For our sake, He did not<br />
even spare His own Son)<br />
<br />
(He did not spare His Son.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 27]</em><br />
Who can accuse those whom<br />
God has elected? God<br />
is the one who makes us<br />
right. Who is the one who<br />
condemns? Christ Jesus is<br />
the one who died, indeed,<br />
He&apos;s been raised to God&apos;s side.<br />
<br />
(Jesus is at God&apos;s side.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 28]</em><br />
Christ has been raised; also<br />
He is at the right hand<br />
of God and intercedes<br />
for us. So then, who can<br />
separate us from the<br />
love of Christ? Or what can<br />
separate us from Him?<br />
<br />
(What can separate us?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 29]</em><br />
Can affliction, distress,<br />
persecution, famine,<br />
nakedness, danger or<br />
sword? As it is written:<br />
Because of you we are<br />
put to death all the day;<br />
counted as sheep to slay.<br />
<br />
(As sheep to be slaughtered.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 30]</em><br />
No, in all these things we<br />
are more than conquerors<br />
through Him who loved us. For<br />
I am persuaded that<br />
nothing can separate<br />
us from the love of God.<br />
<br />
(We&apos;re more than conquerors.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Verse 31]</em><br />
For I am persuaded<br />
that neither death nor life,<br />
angels nor rulers, things<br />
now nor things to come, no<br />
powers, no height or depth,<br />
no created thing can<br />
separate us from the<br />
love of God in Jesus.<br />
<br />
(Nothing can separate.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>[Outro]</em><br />
(He did not spare His Son.)<br />
