<div class="poem-body">
I take my soul for a stroll<br />
Along the crumbling edge<br />
Cliff face, to face<br />
Imagined and the real<br />
<br />
I see my world dissolve<br />
In an unread history book<br />
My space, marked place<br />
Recorded but never told<br />
<br />
I watch and sigh as they divide<br />
My soul and body cannot decide<br />
Can't agree who'll they'll have<br />
Me be, so they fight<br />
