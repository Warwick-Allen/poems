Am I falling<br />
Or am I jumping<br />
I think I jumped<br />
<br />
This hole is too big for me<br />
I cannot see the top<br />
I haven&apos;t yet hit the bottom<br />
<br />
Did I jump<br />
Or was I pushed<br />
I think I jumped<br />
<br />
If only I had a rope<br />
Maybe I could climb the rope<br />
At least I would stop going down<br />
<br />
I&apos;m still falling<br />
I don&apos;t like falling<br />
I think I jumped<br />
<br />
Will you be my rope<br />
You are strong<br />
You won&apos;t break when I climb<br />
<br />
I did jump<br />
But I had help<br />
Why did I jump<br />
<br />
My Lord be my rope<br />
So I won&apos;t fall<br />
I can climb I won&apos;t jump<br />
<br />
They said they wouldn&apos;t let me slip<br />
But they pushed<br />
I think I jumped<br />
<br />
I will see the light<br />
When I reach the top<br />
Of this hole<br />
