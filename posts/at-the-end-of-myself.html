<span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
I&apos;m weary, and my all is not enough,<br />
And the road ahead stretches long and rough.<br />
<span class="ai">I&apos;m</span> kneeling, empty, <span class="ai">nothing left to give,</span><br />
Here, <span class="ai">in surrender, I begin to live.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 1]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
When it&apos;s no longer I, but He who lives in me,<br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
<span class="ai">He lifts me up</span> and <span class="ai">He carries me.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
In front of me, tasks beyond my might, <br />
<span class="ai">And every step,</span> a battle and a fight.<br />
<span class="ai">I&apos;m lost in the struggle, but</span> in this place,<br />
I rest in His mercy, and in His grace.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 2]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
<span class="ai">In the breaking of my pride, His mercy reigns.</span><br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
<span class="ai">He holds me close, through every storm and pain.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br />
All I have to offer is tears and loss,<br />
So I fall before the redeeming cross.<br />
His strength is perfect when I know my weakness.<br />
<span class="ai">In</span> knowing my emptiness, <span class="ai">I find His</span> fullness.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 3]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
<span class="ai">In the stillness of surrender,</span> He will <span class="ai">sustain.</span><br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
Through it all, His grace and power remain.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Bridge]</span><br />
When my race is run,<br />
His has just begun.<br />
When I am undone,<br />
I rest in the Son.<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 4]</span><br />
At the end of myself, is where I find my strength.<br />
<span class="ai">In the ashes of my plans, His hope remains.</span><br />
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.<br />
So here I rest, <span class="ai">in the power of His name.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Outro]</span><br />
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<br />
He leadeth me beside the still waters.<br />
He restoreth my soul:<br />
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness<br />
for his name&apos;s sake.<br />

  <h2>Analysis of <em>At the End of Myself</em> Lyrics</h2>

  <p>
      The song <em>At the End of Myself</em> is a poignant exploration of human
      frailty, spiritual surrender and divine empowerment, deeply rooted in
      Christian theology and scriptural references. Written in a confessional
      and meditative tone, the lyrics articulate a journey from exhaustion and
      inadequacy to reliance on God&apos;s strength. This analysis examines the
      song&apos;s thematic progression, its use of scriptural allusions, and the
      deliberate choice of Bible translations to convey its message.
  </p>

  <h2>Thematic Analysis</h2>
  <p>
      The song&apos;s central theme is the paradox of finding strength in
      weakness through surrender to God. This is introduced in Verse 1, where
      the speaker describes weariness and insufficiency (&#8220;my all is not
      enough&#8221;) but discovers life through surrender.  The recurring motif
      of being &#8220;at the end of myself&#8221; in the choruses underscores a
      state of personal depletion as the prerequisite for divine intervention.
      This aligns with Christian teachings on humility and dependence on God,
      particularly echoed in 2 Corinthians 12:9, where God&apos;s grace is
      sufficient in weakness, a concept implicitly woven throughout the song.
  </p>
  <p>
      Each verse builds on this theme by depicting increasing levels of struggle
      and surrender.  Verse 2 portrays overwhelming tasks and battles, yet finds
      solace in God&apos;s mercy and grace.  Verse 3 deepens the emotional
      intensity, with the speaker offering only &#8220;tears and loss&#8221; at
      the &#8220;redeeming cross,&#8221; a clear reference to Christ&apos;s
      atonement.  The bridge shifts to an eschatological perspective,
      contrasting the speaker&apos;s finite &#8220;race&#8221; with God&apos;s
      eternal work, culminating in rest in &#8220;the Son&#8221; (a
      Christological title).  The outro, quoting Psalm 23, concludes with a
      serene affirmation of God&apos;s guidance and restoration, providing a
      resolution to the song&apos;s earlier turmoil.
  </p>

  <h2>Scriptural References and Translation Choices</h2>
  <p>
      The song is saturated with scriptural allusions, drawing from multiple
      Bible translations to enhance its lyrical and theological impact.  The
      most prominent reference is the repeated line in the choruses, &#8220;I
      can do all things through Him who gives me strength,&#8221; directly
      quoting Philippians 4:13 from the New International Version (NIV).  This
      verse aligns with the song&apos;s theme of divine empowerment in human
      weakness.  The choice of the NIV rendition offers contemporary
      accessibility and rhythmic suitability for lyrical repetition.
  </p>
  <p>
      The outro explicitly quotes Psalm 23:1&#8211;3 from the King James Version
      (KJV), evident in its archaic language: &#8220;He maketh me to lie down in
      green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my
      soul.&#8221;  The KJV&apos;s poetic cadence and solemnity lend a timeless,
      almost liturgical quality to the song&apos;s conclusion, evoking a sense
      of divine comfort and finality.  This contrasts with the NIV&apos;s modern
      phrasing in the choruses, suggesting a deliberate juxtaposition of
      contemporary and traditional expressions of faith to bridge personal
      experience with historical scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
      Other scriptural influences are less explicit but discernible.  For
      instance, Verse 3&apos;s line, &#8220;His strength is perfect when I know
      my weakness,&#8221; echoes 2 Corinthians 12:9: &#8220;My grace is
      sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;  This
      verse informs the song&apos;s nuanced articulation of weakness as a
      conduit for divine strength.  Similarly, the imagery of the
      &#8220;redeeming cross&#8221; in Verse 3 alludes to the crucifixion
      narratives (e.g., 1 Corinthians 1:18), symbolising salvation and
      surrender.  The bridge&apos;s reference to resting &#8220;in the
      Son&#8221; draws from Christological passages like John 15:4&#8211;5,
      where abiding in Christ is essential for spiritual vitality.
  </p>

  <h2>Structural and Poetic Devices</h2>
  <p>
      The song&apos;s structure reinforces its theological message.  The four
      verses and choruses progress from despair to hope, with each chorus
      slightly varying to reflect the speaker&apos;s growing trust in God.  For
      example, Chorus 1 focuses on Christ living in the speaker, while Chorus 4
      speaks of resting &#8220;in the power of His name,&#8221; indicating a
      shift in thought from indwelling to worshipful reliance.  The bridge
      serves as a theological pivot, introducing Christ&apos;s eternal
      perspective, while the outro&apos;s scriptural quotation provides a
      meditative coda.
  </p>
  <p>
      Poetically, the lyrics employ vivid imagery and contrasts.  The
      &#8220;long and rough&#8221; road (Verse 1) and &#8220;storm and
      pain&#8221; (Chorus 2) evoke life&apos;s hardships, while &#8220;green
      pastures&#8221; and &#8220;still waters&#8221; (Outro) offer divine
      respite.  The repetition of &#8220;at the end of myself&#8221; creates a
      rhythmic anchor, mirroring the cyclical nature of spiritual surrender.
      The bridge&apos;s concise parallelism (&#8220;When my race is run, /
      &#8220;His has just begun&#8221;) distils the song&apos;s eschatological
      hope.
  </p>

  <h2>Theological and Emotional Resonance</h2>
  <p>
      The choice of translations&#8212;NIV for the choruses and KJV for the
      outro, with evidence of English Standard Version (ESV) influences
      elsewhere&#8212;reflects a careful curation of scriptural voices.  The
      NIV&apos;s dynamic phrasing in Philippians 4:13 appeals to modern
      listeners, grounding the song&apos;s personal narrative.  The KJV&apos;s
      Psalm 23 invokes a collective, historical faith, connecting the
      individual&apos;s journey to a broader Christian tradition.  The
      ESV&apos;s influence, with its emphasis on precision, supports the
      song&apos;s doctrinal clarity, particularly in its Pauline allusions to
      weakness and grace.  Together, these translations create a multifaceted
      scriptural foundation that resonates both emotionally and theologically.
  </p>
  <p>
      The song&apos;s emotional power lies in its raw vulnerability.  By depicting
      a speaker who is &#8220;weary,&#8221; &#8220;empty,&#8221; and offering only
      &#8220;tears,&#8221; it invites listeners to relate their struggles.  The
      progression from exhaustion to rest mirrors the Christian narrative of
      redemption, making the song a compelling devotional tool.  Its scriptural
      anchoring ensures theological depth, while its lyrical craftsmanship
      ensures universal relatability.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
      <em>At the End of Myself</em> is a lyrically and theologically
      sophisticated song that navigates the tension between human limitation and
      divine strength.  Its scriptural references, drawn from the NIV, KJV and
      ESV, are strategically employed to reinforce its message of surrender and
      empowerment.  The NIV&apos;s Philippians 4:13 drives the song&apos;s
      central affirmation, the KJV&apos;s Psalm 23 provides a timeless
      conclusion, and the ESV&apos;s influence lends doctrinal precision.
      Through its vivid imagery, poetic structure, and emotional authenticity,
      the song offers a profound reflection on faith, making it a resonant piece
      for both personal devotion and communal worship.
