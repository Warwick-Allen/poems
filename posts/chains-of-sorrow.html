<span class="song-segment">[Verse 1]</span><br />
Why so downcast, oh my soul?<br />
Do thou knowest not<br />
Joy is thine to hold?<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 2]</span><br />
Needlessly you ache<br />
You wear the coat of despair<br />
But it is warm, no coat is needed<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 3]</span><br />
Joy for you was bought<br />
At the price of innocent blood<br />
Shed upon a cross<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 4]</span><br />
Do you not know<br />
That you deny His blood<br />
By holding on to sorrow?<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 1]</span><br />
For sorrow is the devil's tool<br />
And melancholy Satan's friend<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 5]</span><br />
&ldquo;Cast away your woes<br />
And lay them upon Me&rdquo;<br />
My saviour says<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 6]</span><br />
Oh, but were it that easy<br />
I hold my sadness tight<br />
In a fist that I can't open<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Chorus 2]</span><br />
For sorrow is my drug<br />
And time my needle<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Bridge]</span><br />
How soothing it is here<br />
Where a slice of fantasy breaks through the reality<br />
And reality into the fantasy<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 7]</span><br />
Still I am aware<br />
That the moment is but fleeting<br />
&mdash;A sigh among the screams<br />
<br />
<span class="song-segment">[Verse 8]</span><br />
I wish the needle would be broken<br />
But I'm not ready for that<br />
I need a new drug<br />

  <h2>Analysis of <em>Chains of Sorrow</em> Lyrics</h2>
    <h3 id="thematic-architecture-and-spiritual-dialectic">
      Thematic Architecture and Spiritual Dialectic
    </h3>
    <p>
      &quot;Chains of Sorrow&quot; presents a sophisticated exploration of the
      tension between Christian theology and psychological reality, structured
      as a dialogue between faith and despair. The lyrical persona engages in
      what might be termed a &quot;theodicy of the soul&quot;—questioning not
      God&#39;s justice in allowing suffering, but rather the individual&#39;s
      complicity in perpetuating their own spiritual and emotional torment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="linguistic-register-and-biblical-resonance">
      Linguistic Register and Biblical Resonance
    </h3>
    <p>
      The opening verses employ deliberately archaic diction (&quot;Do thou
      knowest not,&quot; &quot;Joy is thine to hold&quot;) that immediately
      establishes a biblical register, evoking the Psalms&#39; characteristic
      self-interrogation (c.f. Psalm 43).  This linguistic choice creates
      semantic distance between the speaker and their contemporary suffering,
      suggesting an attempt to frame personal anguish within established
      religious discourse. The shift from archaic to modern vernacular as the
      song progresses mirrors the movement from theological abstraction to
      psychological immediacy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="metaphorical-structures-clothing-commerce-and-chemistry">
      Metaphorical Structures: Clothing, Commerce, and Chemistry
    </h3>
    <p>
      The lyrical architecture relies on three primary metaphorical systems. The
      clothing metaphor (&quot;coat of despair&quot;) suggests depression as
      something worn but removable, whilst the commercial imagery
      (&quot;bought,&quot; &quot;price of innocent blood&quot;) frames salvation
      within transactional terms that ultimately prove insufficient for the
      speaker&#39;s emotional reality. Most significantly, the drug metaphor
      transforms abstract sorrow into concrete addiction, with &quot;time my
      needle&quot; representing a particularly striking image of temporal
      entrapment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="structural-irony-and-theological-paradox">
      Structural Irony and Theological Paradox
    </h3>
    <p>
      The song&#39;s greatest literary achievement lies in its structural irony.
      Whilst early verses present orthodox Christian solutions to despair, the
      speaker simultaneously demonstrates their inability to accept these
      remedies.  The line &quot;Oh, but were it that easy&quot; serves as the
      poem&#39;s emotional fulcrum, acknowledging the gap between intellectual
      assent and experiential transformation. This creates a theological
      paradox: the speaker believes in grace whilst remaining unable to receive
      it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-bridge-as-liminal-space">The Bridge as Liminal Space</h3>
    <p>
      The bridge section functions as both formal and thematic transition,
      representing what anthropologists term &quot;liminal space&quot;—the
      threshold between states of being. The imagery of fantasy and reality
      interpenetrating suggests dissociation or escapism, yet the speaker&#39;s
      awareness that &quot;the moment is but fleeting&quot; prevents complete
      retreat from consciousness. This section demonstrates remarkable
      psychological sophistication in depicting the temporary reprieve that
      fantasy provides from overwhelming reality.
    </p>
    <h3 id="conclusion-addiction-as-spiritual-metaphor">
      Conclusion: Addiction as Spiritual Metaphor
    </h3>
    <p>
      The final verses&#39; equation of sorrow with addiction represents more
      than mere metaphor—it suggests that emotional patterns can exhibit the
      same compulsive, self-destructive characteristics as substance dependency.
      The closing admission &quot;I need a new drug&quot; indicates awareness
      without capacity for change, positioning the speaker in what recovery
      literature terms &quot;pre-contemplative&quot; stage. The song thus
      achieves its literary power not through resolution but through honest
      depiction of spiritual and psychological stasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work&#39;s enduring resonance lies in its refusal to provide easy
      answers to complex emotional realities, instead offering what Keats termed
      &quot;negative capability&quot;—the ability to remain in uncertainty and
      doubt without irritably reaching after fact and reason.
