[Intro]

[Instrumental]

I love the Lord, because he has heard
my voice and my pleas for mercy.

Because he inclined his ear to me,
therefore I will call on him as long as I live.

The snares of death encompassed me;
the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;
I suffered distress and anguish.

Then I called on the name of the Lord:
“O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!”

Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;
our God is merciful.

The Lord preserves the simple;
when I was brought low, he saved me.

Return, O my soul, to your rest;
for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.

For you have delivered my soul from death,
my eyes from tears,
my feet from stumbling;

I will walk before the Lord
in the land of the living.

I believed, even when I spoke,
“I am greatly afflicted”;

I said in my alarm,
“All mankind are liars.”

What shall I render to the Lord
for all his benefits to me?

I will lift up the cup of salvation
and call on the name of the Lord,

I will pay my vows to the Lord
in the presence of all his people.

Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of his saints.

O Lord, I am your servant;
I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.
You have loosed my bonds.

I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving
and call on the name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows to the Lord
in the presence of all his people,

in the courts of the house of the Lord,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.

Praise the Lord!
